<br /><span class="small">FOUR GIRLS FACE A PROBLEM</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Now that the crash is over and the last echo has
ceased to reverberate through our ancestral halls, the
problem before the house is what shall the family
of Vandergrifts do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gloria, I do wish you wouldn&rsquo;t stand there grinning
like a Cheshire cat. There certainly is nothing
amusing about the whirlwind of a catastrophe that
we have just been through and are still in, for that
matter.&rdquo; Gwendolyn tapped her bronze-slippered toe
impatiently as she sat in a luxuriously upholstered
chair in what, until this past week, had been the
library in the Long Island home of the proud family
of Vandergrifts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>Gloria, the oldest of the four girls, ceased to smile
but the pleasant expression, which was habitual to
the blue eyes, did not entirely vanish as she inquired,
&ldquo;What would you have me do, Gwen? Fret
and fume as you are doing? That is no way to readjust
your life to new and changed conditions.
Face the facts squarely, say I, and then try to find
some way to surmount your difficulties. Now first
of all, we ought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark, handsome Gwendolyn, whose natural
selfishness was plainly portrayed in a drooping
mouth and petulant expression, put her fingers in
her ears, saying: &ldquo;If you are going to preach, I
can assure you that I am not going to listen; so you
might as well save your breath until&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush. Here comes Lena May in from the garden.
Don&rsquo;t let her hear us scrapping. It effects her
sensitive soul as discord effects a true musician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena May entered through the porch door, her
arms filled with blossoming branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, sisters, aren&rsquo;t apple blossoms even sweeter
than usual this year?&rdquo; the slip of a girl began, then
paused and glanced from one face to the other.
&ldquo;Gwen, what is wrong?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>But it was Gloria who replied, &ldquo;Nothing at all,
Pet. That is, nothing &lsquo;wronger&rsquo; than usual, if you
will permit my lapse of grammar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>But the dark-eyed sister threw down the book
which she had been trying to read, as she exclaimed,
&ldquo;You both know perfectly well than nothing
could be in more of a muddle than our lives
are at the present moment and your &lsquo;look for the
silver lining,&rsquo; philosophy, Gloria Vandergrift, doesn&rsquo;t
help <i>me</i> in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fawn-like eyes of the frail, youngest sister
turned inquiringly toward the oldest. &ldquo;Has anything
more happened, I mean, anything new?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, we had a letter from Father&rsquo;s lawyer
and he states than beyond a doubt our place here on
Long Island does not belong to us and, for that matter,
it never did really. Grandfather bought it in
good faith, I am sure, but he did not receive a clear
title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why doesn&rsquo;t our lawyer clear it up? That&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; Gwen said, throwing herself
petulantly into another position. &ldquo;Why did
Father employ him, if he cannot attend to our legal
matters?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Gwen, dear, can&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; Gloria
began to explain with infinite patience. &ldquo;When Father
died, leaving four orphaned daughters, we knew
that the fortune he had inherited had been lost
through unwise investments, but we did think that
the income from this vast acreage and the tenants
would be sufficient to permit us to live in about the
same comfortable way that we always have, but
now we find that even this place is not ours and
that we are&mdash;well, up against it, as Bobs would
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Bobs?&rdquo; This from Lena May, who
was arranging the sprays of apple blossoms in a
large pale-green bowl on a low wicker stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out of yonder window and you will see
the object of your inquiry,&rdquo; Gloria laughed as she
pointed toward the park-like grounds where a hoidenish
young girl of 17 could be seen riding astride
a slender high-spirited black horse with a white star
in his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish Roberta wouldn&rsquo;t wear that outlandish
costume,&rdquo; Gwendolyn began, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more
I can&rsquo;t see why she wants to be galloping around
the country in that fashion when a calamity like
this is staring us in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>The horse had disappeared beyond the shrubbery.
The sisters supposed that the young rider would
go down to the stables and so they were somewhat
startled, a second later, by seeing Bobs vault over
the sill of an open window and land in their midst.</p>
<p>Gwendolyn, of course, rebuked her. &ldquo;Roberta
Vandergrift, aren&rsquo;t you ever going to become ladylike?&rdquo;
she admonished.</p>
<p>The newcomer was about to retort that she hoped
not if Gwen was a sample, but Gloria intervened.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ladylike, Bobs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now, more
than ever, we need a man in the family. But come,
let&rsquo;s talk peaceably together and decide what we
are to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Roberta tossed her hat to one side
and sat tailor-wise on the floor, adding: &ldquo;Fire
ahead, I&rsquo;m present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such language,&rdquo; was what Gwendolyn refrained
from saying, but Bobs chuckled in wicked glee. She
thought it jolly fun to shock &ldquo;Miss Prunes and
Prisms,&rdquo; as she called the sister but one year her
senior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gloria, whatever you suggest, I know will be
best,&rdquo; little Lena May said, as she slipped a trusting
hand into that of the oldest sister. &ldquo;Now, tell us,
what is your plan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>The oldest girl was thoughtful for a moment,
then said: &ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know that I have
made one very far ahead, but of course we must
leave here. That is the inevitable, and, equally of
course, we must find some way of earning our daily
bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bread, indeed,&rdquo; sniffed the disdainful Gwendolyn.
&ldquo;You know that I never eat such a plebian
thing as bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may work to earn cake if you prefer,&rdquo;
Bobs told her, then leaning forward she added
eagerly: &ldquo;I say, Gloria, it&rsquo;s going to be a great adventure,
isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ve always been so envious of
people who actually earned their own way in the
world. It shows there is something in them. Anyone
can be a parasite, but the person who is worth
while isn&rsquo;t contented to be one. Ever since Kathryn
De Laney went to little old New York town to take
a course in nursing that she might do something
big in the world, I&rsquo;ve had the itch to do likewise.
Getting up at noon and then dwaddling away the
hours until midnight is all very well for those who
like it, but not for mine! I&rsquo;ve been wishing that
something would jar us out of the rut we&rsquo;re in, and
I, for one, am glad that it has come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Kathryn De Laney is a disgrace to her family.&rdquo;
This, scornfully, from Gwen. &ldquo;A girl with a million
in her own name could hire people to do all the
nursing she wished done without going into dirty,
slummy places herself, and actually waiting on immigrants,
the very sight of whom would make me
feel ill. I never even permit Hawkins to drive me
through the poorer sections of the city and, if I am
obliged to pass through the tenement district, I close
the windows that I need not breath the polluted air;
and I also draw the curtains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt that you do,&rdquo; Bobs said, eyeing her
sister almost coldly. &ldquo;I sometimes wonder where
our mother got you, anyway. You haven&rsquo;t one resemblance
to that dear little woman who, when the
squalid hamlet down by the sound was burned,
opened her home and took them all in. We were too
small to remember it ourselves, but I&rsquo;ve heard Father
tell about it time and again, and he would always
end the story by saying, &lsquo;My dearest wish is that my
four girls each grow up to be just such an angel
woman as their mother was.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor was that all,&rdquo; Lena May put in, a tender
light glowing in her soft brown eyes. &ldquo;Mother herself
superintended the rebuilding of the hamlet which
has now grown to be the model town along the
sound.&rdquo; Then, looking lovingly up at the oldest
sister, she continued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, Gloria, that you are
so like our mother. But you haven&rsquo;t as yet told me
your plan and I am sure that you must at least have
the beginning of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I said before, we must leave here and go
to work,&rdquo; Gloria replied. &ldquo;I suppose the best thing
would be for us to go to New York, where so many
varieties of endeavor await us. Mr. Corey thinks
that there will be about one hundred dollars a month
for us to live on. That will be twenty-five dollars
for each of us, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five dollars, indeed? I can&rsquo;t even get a
hat for that, and I certainly shall need one to wear
to Phyllis De Laney&rsquo;s lawn party on the 18th of
June if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t be here then, Gwen, so you might
as well not plan to attend,&rdquo; Gloria said seriously.
&ldquo;We are obliged to vacate this place by the first of
June. The Grabbersteins, who claim their ancestors
were the original owners, will move in on that day,
bag and baggage, and so my suggestion is that we
leave the week previous, that we need not meet
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thought what you will do to earn
money?&rdquo; Lena May asked Gloria.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Miss Lovejoy of the East Seventy-seventh
Street Settlement has asked me to take charge of the
girls&rsquo; clubs and I have accepted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gloria Vandergrift; you, a daughter of one of
the very oldest families in this country, to work,
actually work in those dreadful smelling slums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gloria looked almost with pity at the speaker, who,
of course, was Gwendolyn, as she said: &ldquo;Do you
realize that being born an aristocrat is merely an
accident? You might have been born in the slums,
Gwen, and if you had been, wouldn&rsquo;t you be glad to
have someone come to you and give you a chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There being no reply, Gloria continued: &ldquo;I take
no credit to myself because I happened to be born in
luxury and not in poverty, but we&rsquo;ll have to postpone
this conversation, for our neighbors are evidently
coming to call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs sprang to her feet and leaped to the open
window. &ldquo;Hello there, Phyl and Dick! Come
around this way and I&rsquo;ll open the porch door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwendolyn shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t
Roberta allow Peter to admit our visitors,&rdquo; she
began, but Gloria interrupted: &ldquo;One excellent reason,
perhaps, is that all our servants except the cook left
this morning. You, of course, were still asleep and
did not know of the exodus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>The sharp retort on the tongue of Gwendolyn was
not uttered, for Phyllis De Laney and her big, good-looking
brother, Richard, were entering the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor dear girls! Just as soon as I heard
the news I came right over,&rdquo; Phyllis De Laney exclaimed
as she sank down in a deep, comfortable
chair and looked about at her friends with an expression
of frank curiosity on her doll-pretty face.
&ldquo;However, I told Ma Mere that I knew there wasn&rsquo;t
a word of truth in the scandalous gossip, and so I
came to hear how it all started that I may be able
to contradict it.&rdquo; Phyllis took a breath and then
continued her chatter: &ldquo;Your maid, Gwen, told my
Fanchon, and she said that every servant in your
employ had been dismissed with two weeks&rsquo; advance
pay; and she said a good deal more than that too,
which, of course, isn&rsquo;t true. Just listen to this and
then tell me if it isn&rsquo;t simply scandalous. That maid
declared that you girls are going to work, actually
work, to earn your own living.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; Roberta put in, grinning with
wicked glee. Her good pal, Dick, smiled over at her
as he remarked with evident amusement: &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t look very miserable about it, Bobs. In fact,
quite the contrary, you appear pleased. If the truth
were known, I envy you, honestly I do! I&rsquo;d much
rather go to work than go to college. I&rsquo;m no good
at Latin or Greek. If languages are dead, bury
them, I say. I&rsquo;m not a student by nature, so what&rsquo;s
the use pretending; but the pater won&rsquo;t hear to it.
Just because our grandfather left us each a million,
we&rsquo;ve got to dwaddle away our lives spending it. Of
course I&rsquo;m nineteen now, but you wait until I&rsquo;m
twenty-one years old and see what will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sister Phyllis lifted her eyebrows ever so
slightly and looked her disapproval. &ldquo;In that time
you will have changed your mind,&rdquo; she remarked.
Then turning to her particular friend, she added:
&ldquo;But, Gwen, you aren&rsquo;t going to work, are you?
Pray, what could you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwendolyn was in no pleasant frame of mind as
her sisters well knew, and her reply was most ungraciously
given. Curtly she stated that she did not
care to discuss her personal affairs with anyone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Phyllis flushed and rose at once, saying coldly:
&ldquo;Indeed? Since when have you become so secretive?
You always tell me everything you do and
so I had no reason to suppose that you would object
to my friendly inquiry; but you need have no fear,
I shall never again intrude upon your privacy. I will
bid you all good afternoon and good-bye, for, of
course, since you are going to New York to work,
I suppose as clerks in the shops, we will not likely
meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I say, Sis, cut it out! What&rsquo;s the big idea,
anyway? A friend is a friend, isn&rsquo;t he, whether he
wears broadcloth or overalls?&rdquo; Then as his sister
continued to sweep out of the room, the lad crossed
to the oldest sister and held out his hand, saying,
with sincere boyish sympathy, &ldquo;Gloria, I&rsquo;m mighty
sorry about this&mdash;er&mdash;this&mdash;well, whatever it is, and
please let me know where you go, and as soon as
you&rsquo;re settled I&rsquo;ll run over and play the big brother
act, if you&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning to Bobs, he said: &ldquo;Go riding with
me at sunrise tomorrow morning, will you, like we
used to do before I went away to school. There&rsquo;s
a lot I want to say, and the day after I&rsquo;m going to
be packed off to the academy again to be tortured
for another month; then, thanks be, vacation will
let me out of that prison for a while.&rdquo; Roberta hesitated,
and Dick urged: &ldquo;Go on, Bob! Be a sport.
Say yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll be at the Twin Oaks, where we&rsquo;ve
met ever since we were little shavers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the door closed behind the departing guests
Gloria turned to the sister, who was but one year
her junior, and said: &ldquo;Gwendolyn, I am sorry to say
this, but the good of the larger number requires it.
If you cannot face the changed conditions cheerfully
with us, I shall have to ask you to make your plans
independent of us. We three have decided to be
brave and courageous, and try to find joy and happiness
in whatever may present itself, just as our
mother and father would wish us to do, and just as
they would have done had similar circumstances
overtaken them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwendolyn rose and walked toward the door, but
turned to say, &ldquo;You need not concern yourselves
about me in the least. I shall not go with you to
New York. I shall visit my dear friend Eloise
Rochester in Newport, as she has often begged me
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent plan, if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Gloria began, then
paused.</p>
<p>Gwendolyn turned and inquired haughtily, &ldquo;If
what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Eloise wants you when she hears that you
have neither home nor wealth. If I am anything of
a character reader, I should say that the invitation
about which you have just told was merely a bait,
so to speak, for a return invitation. It is quite evident
that Eloise has decided to marry Richard De
Laney&rsquo;s million-dollar inheritance, and since Phyllis
will not invite her to their home you, as a next-door
neighbor, can be used to advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? Well, luckily Miss Vandergrift, you
are <i>not</i> a character reader, as you will learn in the
near future. You three make whatever plans you
wish, but do not include me.&rdquo; So saying, Gwendolyn
left the room and a few moments later the three
sisters heard her moving about in the apartment
overhead, and they correctly assumed that she was
packing, preparatory for her departure to Newport.</p>
<p>Gloria sighed: &ldquo;I wonder why Gwen is so unlike
our mother and father?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; Bobs cried, whirling about with eyes
laughingly aglow. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a changeling! A discontented
nurse girl wished to wreak vengeance upon
Mother for having discharged her, or something like
that, and so she stole the child who really was our
sister and left this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Bobsie!&rdquo; Lena May protested. &ldquo;Even if
Gwen is selfish, maybe we are to blame. She was
ill for so long after Mother died that we couldn&rsquo;t
bear the thought of having two deaths, and so we
rather spoiled her. I believe that if we meet her
contrariness with love and are very patient we may
find the gold that must be in her nature, since she <i>is</i>
our mother&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do it, if it&rsquo;s do-able, Lena May,&rdquo; Bobs
declared. &ldquo;Now, Gloria, break the glad news! When
do we hit the trail for the big town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in tomorrow to find a place for us to
live. If you girls wish, you may accompany me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish? Why, all the king&rsquo;s oxen and all the
king&rsquo;s men couldn&rsquo;t keep me from going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gloria smiled at her hoidenish sister but refrained
from commenting on her language. She was so
thankful that there was only one Gwen in the family
that she could overlook lesser failings. Bobs was
taking the mishap that had befallen them as a great
adventure, but even she did not dream of the truly
exciting adventures that lay before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">A PROPOSAL</span></h2>
<p>Soon after daybreak the next morning, down a
deserted country road, two thoroughbred horses
were galloping neck and neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee along, Star,&rdquo; Bobs was shouting. She had
lost her hat a mile back and her short hair, which
would ripple, though she tried hard to brush out the
natural curls, was tossed about her head, making her
look more hoidenish than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Dick, on his slender brown horse, gradually won
a lead and was a length ahead when they reached
the Twin Oaks, which for many years had been their
trysting place. Roberta and Dick had been playmates
and then pals, squabbling and making up, ever
since the pinafore days, more, however, like two
boys than a boy and a girl. Bobs, in fact, never
thought of herself as a young person who in due
time would become a marriageable young lady, and
so it was with rather a shock of surprise that she
heard Dick say, when they had drawn their horses
to a standstill in the shade of the wide-spreading
trees: &ldquo;I say, Roberta, couldn&rsquo;t you cut out this
going to work stuff and marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye gods and little fishes! <i>Me</i> marry you?&rdquo;
Bobs&rsquo; remark and the accompanying expression in
her round, sunburned face, with its pertly tilting
freckled nose, were none too complimentary.</p>
<p>Dick flushed. &ldquo;Well, I say! What&rsquo;s the matter
with me, anyhow? Anyone might think, by the way
you&rsquo;re staring, that I had said something dreadful.
I&rsquo;m not deformed, am I? And I&rsquo;ve got money
enough so you wouldn&rsquo;t have to work ever and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Roberta became a girl at once, a girl with a sincere
nature and a tender heart. Reaching out a
strong brown hand, she placed it kindly on the arm
of her friend. &ldquo;Dicky, boy, forgive me, if&mdash;if I was
a little astonished and showed it. Truth is, for so
many years I&rsquo;ve thought of you as the playmate
I could always count on to fight my battles, that I&rsquo;d
sort of forgotten that we were grown up enough to
even think of marrying. Of course we aren&rsquo;t grown
up enough yet to really marry, for you are only
nineteen, and I&rsquo;m worse than that, being not yet
seventeen. And as for money, Dick, I&rsquo;d like you
heaps better if you were poor and working your
way, but I know that you meant what you said most
kindly. You wanted to save me from hard knocks,
but, Dick, honest Injun, I revel in them. That is, I
suppose I will. Never having had one as yet, I can&rsquo;t
speak from past experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they rode slowly back to find the hat that
had blown off into the bushes. Dick rescued it, and
when he returned it he handed her a spray from a
blossoming wild rose vine.</p>
<p>The lad did not again refer to his offer, and the
girl, he noted with an inward sigh, had evidently
forgotten all about it. She was gazing about her
appreciatively. &ldquo;Dicky boy,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
nothing much prettier than early morning in the
country, is there, with the dew still sparkling&mdash;and
a meadow lark singing,&rdquo; she added, for at that
moment a joyous song arose from a near-by thicket.</p>
<p>For a time they were silent as they rode slowly
back by the way they had come. Then Dick said,
&ldquo;Bobs, since you love the country so dearly, aren&rsquo;t
you afraid you&rsquo;ll be homesick in that human whirlpool,
New York?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>The girl turned toward him brightly. &ldquo;Perhaps,
sometimes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t far to the
country when I feel the need of a deep breath of
fresh air.&rdquo; Then her face saddened as she continued:
&ldquo;Of course we won&rsquo;t be coming out here
any more.&rdquo; She waved toward the vast estate which
for many years had been the home of Vandergrifts.
&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t stand it, not one of us could, to see
strangers living where Mother and Father were so
happy. They&rsquo;ll probably change things a lot.&rdquo; Then
she added almost passionately: &ldquo;I hope they will.
Then, if ever I <i>do</i> see it again, it will not look like
the same place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick did not say what was in his heart, but
gloomily he realized that if the girl at his side did
not expect ever to return to that neighborhood, it
was quite evident that she would not be his wife, for
his home adjoined that of the Vandergrifts.</p>
<p>When he spoke, his words in no way betrayed his
thoughts. &ldquo;Have you any idea, Bobs, what you&rsquo;d like
to do, over there in the big city; I mean to make a
living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed; then sent a merry side glance
toward her companion. &ldquo;You never could guess in
a thousand years,&rdquo; she flung at him, then challenged;
&ldquo;Try!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>The boy flicked his quirt at the drooping branches
of a willow they were passing, then frankly confessed
that he couldn&rsquo;t picture Roberta in any of
the occupations for women of which he had ever
heard. Mischievously she queried, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I
make a nice demure saleswoman for ladies&rsquo; dresses
or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns, <i>No</i>!&rdquo; was the explosive interruption.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put such a strain on my imagination.&rdquo; Then
he laughed gaily, for he was evidently trying to picture
the hoidenish girl mincing up and down in some
fashionable emporium dressed in the latest styles,
while women peered at her through lorgnettes. Bobs
laughed with him when he told his thoughts, then
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll agree, as a model, I won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; Then with
pretended thoughtfulness she flicked a fly from her
horse&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Would I make a good actress, Dicky,
do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a better circus performer,&rdquo; the boy
told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget the antics we used to
pull, before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before I realized that I was a girl and <i>had</i> to be
ladylike.&rdquo; Bobs laughed with him, then added merrily,
&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for my prunes and prisms,
Sister Gwendolyn, I might <i>never</i> have ceased to be
a tom-boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you never will become like Gwen,&rdquo; Dick
said almost fiercely, &ldquo;or like my sister Phyllis, either.
They&rsquo;re not <i>our kind</i>, though I&rsquo;m sorry to say it.&rdquo;
Then noting a far-away, thoughtful expression
which had crept into the girl&rsquo;s eyes, the lad inquired:
&ldquo;Say, Bobs, have you any idea <i>how</i> Gwyn <i>can</i> earn
a living? You&rsquo;re the sort who can hold your own
anywhere. You&rsquo;d be willing to work, but Gwyn&mdash;well,
I can&rsquo;t picture her as a daily-bread earner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companion shook her head; then quite unexpectedly
she said: &ldquo;Dick, why <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> you fall in
love with Gwen? It would have solved her problem
to have had someone nice and rich to take care of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the unheard of preposterous suggestions!&rdquo;
The amazed youth was so astonished that
he unconsciously drew rein and stared at the girl.
He knew by her merry laugh that she had said it
but to tease, and so he rode on again at her side.
Bobs feared that she had hurt her friend, for his
face was still flushed and he did not speak. Reining
her horse close to his, she again put a hand on his
arm, saying with sincere earnestness: &ldquo;Forgive me,
pal of mine, if I seemed to speak lightly. Honestly,
I didn&rsquo;t mean it&mdash;that is, not as it sounded. But I
<i>do</i> wish that someone as nice and&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll say as
rich as you are, <i>would</i> propose to poor Gwen. You
don&rsquo;t know how sorry Gloria and I feel because
Gwen has to be poor with the rest of us.&rdquo; The boy
had placed his hand over the one resting on his arm,
but only for a moment. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Bobs explained,
&ldquo;Glow and I honestly feel that an adventure of a
new and interesting kind awaits us, and, as for little
Lena May, money means nothing to her. If she can
just be with Gloria, that is all she asks of Fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the Vandergrift gate and Bobs,
drawing rein, reached out her hand, saying: &ldquo;Goodbye,
Dick.&rdquo; Then, after a hesitating moment, she
added sincerely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, old pal. I wish I could
have said yes&mdash;that is, if it means a lot to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy held her hand in a firm clasp as he replied
earnestly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to give up hoping, Bobsie.
I&rsquo;ll put that question on the table for a couple of
years, but, when I am twenty-one, I&rsquo;m going to hit
the trail for <i>wherever</i> you are, and ask it all over
again. You see if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t if Eloise Rochester has anything to
say about it,&rdquo; was the girl&rsquo;s merry rejoinder. Then
as Bobs turned her horse toward the stables, she
called over her shoulder: &ldquo;O, I say, Dick, I forgot
to tell you the profession I&rsquo;ve chosen. I&rsquo;m going to
a girl detective.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">VENTURING FORTH</span></h2>
<p>When Roberta entered the breakfast room, she
found Gloria and Lena May there waiting for her.
In answer to her question, the oldest sister replied
that Gwen would not unlock her door. Lena May
had left her breakfast on a tray in the hall. &ldquo;We
think she is packing to leave,&rdquo; Gloria sighed. &ldquo;The
way Gwen takes our misfortune is the hardest thing
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs, who was ravenously hungry after her early
morning ride, was eating her breakfast with a relish
which contrasted noticeably with the evident lack of
appetite shown by her sisters. At last she said:
&ldquo;Glow, I&rsquo;m not so sure all this is really a misfortune.
If something hadn&rsquo;t happened to jolt us out of a rut,
we would have settled down here and led a humdrum,
monotonous life, going to teas and receptions,
bridge parties and week-ends, played tennis and golf,
married and died, and nothing real or vital would
have happened. But, now, take it from me, I, for
one, am going to really live, not stagnate or rust.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Gloria smiled as she hastened to assure her sister:
&ldquo;I agree with you, Bobs. I&rsquo;m glad something <i>has</i>
happened to make it possible for me to carry out a
long-cherished desire of mine. I haven&rsquo;t said much
about it, but ever since Kathryn De Laney came
home last summer on a vacation and told me about
the girls of the East Side who have never had a real
chance to develop the best that is in them, I have
wanted to help them. I didn&rsquo;t know how to go about
doing it, not until the crash came. Then I wrote
Kathryn, and you know what happened next. She
found a place for me in the Settlement House to
conduct social clubs for those very girls of whom
she had told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of the listeners noted the eager, earnest expression
on the truly beautiful face of the sister
who had mothered them, but almost at once it had
saddened, and they knew that again she was thinking
of Gwen. Directly after breakfast Gloria went
once more to the upper hall and tapped on a closed
and locked door, but there was no response from
within. However, the breakfast tray which Lena
May had left on a near table was not in sight, and
so, at least, Gwendolyn was not going hungry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>It seemed strange to the two younger girls to be
clearing away the breakfast things and tidying up
the kitchen where, for so many years, a good-natured
Chinaman had reigned supreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to miss Sing more than any servant
that we ever had,&rdquo; Bobs was saying when Gloria
entered the kitchen. There was a serious expression
on the face of the oldest girl and Bobs refrained
from uttering the flippancy which had been on the
tip of her tongue. Lena May, having put away the
dishes, turned to ask solicitously: &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t Gwen
let you in, Glow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t hear a sound, but the tray is gone.&rdquo;
The gentle Lena May was pleased to hear that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Gwen, she is making it harder for herself
and for all of us,&rdquo; Gloria said; then added, &ldquo;Are
you girls ready to go with me? I&rsquo;d like to get over
to the city early, after the first rush is over and the
midday rush has not begun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Exultant Bobs could not refrain from waving the
dishcloth she still held. &ldquo;Hurray for us!&rdquo; she sang
out. &ldquo;Three adventurers starting on they know not
what wild escapade. Wait until I change my togs,
Glow, and I&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo; Then, glancing down
at her riding habit, &ldquo;Unless this will do?&rdquo; she questioned
her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, dear. We&rsquo;ll all wear tailored
suits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was midmorning when three fashionably attired
girls for the first time in their lives ascended to the
Third Avenue Elevated, going uptown. At that hour
there were few people traveling in that direction and
they had a car almost to themselves. As they were
whirled past tenements, so close that they could
plainly see the shabby furniture in the flats beyond,
the younger girls suddenly realized how great was
the contrast between the life that was ahead of them
and that which they were leaving. The thundering of
the trains, the constant rumble of traffic below, the
discordant cries of hucksters, reached them through
the open windows. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe that a
meadow lark is singing anywhere in the world,&rdquo;
Bobs said, turning to Gloria. &ldquo;Or that little children
are playing in those meadows,&rdquo; the older girl replied.
She was watching the pale, ragged children
hanging to railings around fire escapes on a level
with the train windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little things!&rdquo; Lena May&rsquo;s tone was pitying,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they can do much playing in
such cramped, crowded places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose they even know the meaning of
the word,&rdquo; Bobs replied.</p>
<p>They left the train at the station nearest the
Seventy-seventh Street Settlement. Since Gloria
was to be employed there, she planned starting from
that point to search for the nearest suitable dwelling.
They found themselves in a motley crowd composed
of foreign women and children, who jostled
one another in an evident effort to reach the sidewalk
where, in two-wheeled carts, venders of all kinds of
things salable were calling their wares. &ldquo;They must
sell everything from fish to calico,&rdquo; Bobs reported
after a moment&rsquo;s inspection from the curbing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>The women, who wore shawls of many colors over
their heads and who carried market baskets and
babies, were, some of them, Bohemians and others
Hungarian. Few words of English were heard by
the interested girls. &ldquo;I see where I have to acquire
a new tongue if I am to know what our future
neighbors are talking about,&rdquo; Bobs had just said,
when, suddenly, just ahead of them, a thin, sickly
woman slipped and would have fallen had not a
laboring man who was passing caught her just in
time. The grateful woman coughed, her hand
pressed to her throat, before she could thank him.
The girls saw that she had potatoes in a basket which
seemed too heavy for her. The man was apparently
asking where she lived; then he assisted her toward
a near tenement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bobs exclaimed, &ldquo;there is evidently chivalry
among working men as well as among idlers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the crossing they were caught in a jam of
traffic and pedestrians. Little Lena May clung to
Gloria&rsquo;s arm, looking about as though terrorized at
this new and startling experience. When, after some
moments&rsquo; delay, the opposite sidewalk was reached
in safety, Bobs exclaimed gleefully: &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that
great?&rdquo; But Lena May had not enjoyed the experience,
and it was quite evident to the other two that
it was going to be very hard for their sensitive, frail
youngest sister to be transplanted from her gardens,
where she had spent long, quiet, happy hours, painting
the scenes she loved, to this maelstrom of foreign
humanity. There was almost a pang of regret
in the heart of the girl who had mothered the others
when she realized fully, for the first time, what her
own choice of a home location might mean to their
youngest. Perhaps she had been selfish, because of
her own great interest in Settlement Work, to plan
to have them all live on the crowded East Side, but
her fears were set at rest a moment later when they
came upon a group of children, scarcely more than
babies, who were playing in a gutter. Lena May&rsquo;s
sweet face brightened and, smiling up at Gloria, she
exclaimed: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they dears, in spite of the rags
and dirt? I&rsquo;d love to do something for them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to put them all in a tub of soap-suds and
give them a good scrubbing for once in their lives,&rdquo;
the practical Bobs remarked. Then she caught
Gloria by the arm, exclaiming, as she nodded toward
a crossing, &ldquo;There goes that chivalrous laboring
man. He steps off with too much agility to be a
ditch-digger, or anyone who does hard work, doesn&rsquo;t
he, Glow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The oldest sister laughed. &ldquo;Bobs,&rdquo; she remarked,
&ldquo;I sometimes think that you are a detective by
nature. You are always trying to discover by the
cut of a man&rsquo;s hair what his profession may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs&rsquo; hazel eyes were merry, though her face was
serious. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it, Glow!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I
was going to keep it a secret a while longer, but I
might as well confess, now that the cat is out of
the bag.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What cat?&rdquo; Lena May had only heard half of
this sentence; she had been so interested in watching
the excitement among the children caused by the
approach of an organ grinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My chosen profession is the cat,&rdquo; Bobs informed
her, &ldquo;and I suppose my brain, where it has been hiding,
is the bag. I&rsquo;m going to be a detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Lena May was horrified. Detectives meant
to her sleuths who visited underground haunts of
crooks of all kinds. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Gloria will not wish
it, will you, Glow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Appealingly the soft brown eyes were lifted and
met the smiling gaze of the oldest sister. &ldquo;We are
each to do the work for which we are best fitted,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;You are to be our little housekeeper
and that will give you time to go on with your painting.
I was just wondering a moment ago if you
might not like to put some of these black-eyed Hungarian
babies into a picture. If they are clean, they
would be unusually beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Lena May was interested at once and glanced
about for possible subjects, and so for the time being
the startling statement of Bobs&rsquo; chosen profession
was dropped. They were nearing the East River,
very close to which stood a large, plain brick
building containing many windows. &ldquo;I believe that
is the Settlement House,&rdquo; Gloria had just said, when
Bobs, discovering the name over the door, verified
the statement.</p>
<p>A pretty Hungarian girl of about their own age
answered their ring and admitted them to a big
cheerful clubroom. Another girl was practicing on
a piano in a far corner. The three newcomers seated
themselves near the door and looked about with
great interest. Just beyond were shelves of books.
Bobs sauntered over to look at the titles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
dandy collection for girls,&rdquo; she reported as she again
took her seat.</p>
<p>It was not long before Miss Lovejoy, the matron
entered the room and advanced toward them. The
three girls rose to greet her.</p>
<p>Miss Lovejoy smilingly held out a hand to the
tallest, saying in her pleasant, friendly voice, &ldquo;I wonder
if I am right in believing that <i>you</i> are the Miss
Gloria Vandergrift who is coming to assist me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Lovejoy, I am, and these are my
younger sisters, Roberta and little Lena May.&rdquo; Then
she explained: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t moved into town as yet.
I thought best to come over this morning and find a
place for us to live; then we will have our trunks
sent and our personal possessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a good idea,&rdquo; the matron said, then
asked: &ldquo;Have you found anything as yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought, since we are strangers in the
neighborhood, that you might be able to suggest
some place for us,&rdquo; Gloria told the matron.</p>
<p>After a thoughtful moment Miss Lovejoy replied:
&ldquo;The tenement houses in this immediate neighborhood
are most certainly not desirable for one used
to comforts. However, on Seventy-eighth Street,
there is a new model tenement built by some wealthy
women and it is just possible that there may be a
vacant flat. You might inquire at the office there.
You can take the short-cut path across the playground
and it will lead you directly to the model
tenement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Lovejoy,&rdquo; Gloria said. &ldquo;We
will let you know the result of our search.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">A HAUNTED HOUSE</span></h2>
<p>The model tenement which Miss Lovejoy had
pointed out to them was soon reached. A door on
the ground floor was labeled &ldquo;Office,&rdquo; and so Gloria
pushed the electric button.</p>
<p>A trim young woman whose long-lashed, dark
eyes suggested her nationality, received them, but
regretted to have to tell them that every flat in the
model tenement was occupied. She looked, with but
slightly concealed curiosity, at these three applicants
who, as was quite evident, were from other environments.</p>
<p>Gloria glanced about the neat courtyard and up at
windows where flowers were blossoming in bright
window boxes, then glowingly she turned back to
the girl: &ldquo;It was a splendid thing for those wealthy
society women to do, wasn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;erecting
this really handsome yellow brick building in the
midst of so much poverty and squalor. It must have
a most uplifting effect on the lives of the poor people
to be able to live here where everything is so sweet
and clean, rather than there,&rdquo; nodding, as she spoke,
at a building across the street which looked gloomy,
crumbling, unsafe and unsanitary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>The office attendant spoke with enthusiasm. &ldquo;No
one knows better than I, for I used to live in the
other kind of tenement when I was a child, but Miss
Lovejoy&rsquo;s club for factory girls gave me my chance
to learn bookkeeping, and now I am agent here. My
name is Miss Selenski. Would you like to see the
model apartment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Indeed we would,&rdquo; Gloria replied
with enthusiasm; then she added, &ldquo;Miss Selenski,
I am Miss Vandergrift, and these are my sisters,
Roberta and Lena May. We hope to be your
neighbors soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there was a natural curiosity in the heart of the
dark-eyed girl, she said nothing of it, and at once led
the way through the neatly tiled halls and soon
opened a door admitting them to a small flat of three
rooms, which was clean and attractively furnished.
The windows, flooded with sunlight, overlooked the
East River.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the apartment that we show,&rdquo; Miss Selenski
explained. &ldquo;The others are just like it, or were,
before tenants moved in,&rdquo; she corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this <i>is</i> sure cosy! Who lives in this one?&rdquo;
Bobs inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Miss Selenski replied, hurrying to add,
&ldquo;But I did not fit it up. The ladies did that. It has
all the modern appliances that help to make housekeeping
easy, and once every week a teacher comes
here to instruct the neighborhood women how to
cook, clean and sew; in fact, how to live. And the
lessons and demonstrations are given in this apartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the girls were again in the office, Gloria
turned to their new acquaintance, saying, &ldquo;Do you
happen to know of any place around here that is
vacant where we might like to live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Miss Selenski shook her head. Then she
added, with a queer little smile, &ldquo;Not unless you&rsquo;re
willing to live in the old Pensinger mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she went on to explain: &ldquo;Long, long ago,
when New York was little more than a village, and
Seventy-eighth Street was country, all along the East
River there were, here and there, handsome mansion-like
homes and vast grounds. Oh, so different from
what it is now! Every once in a while you find one
of these old dwellings still standing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them house many poor families, but the
Pensinger mansion is seldom occupied. If a family
is brave enough to move in, before many weeks the
&lsquo;for rent&rsquo; sign is again at the door. The rent is
almost nothing, but&mdash;&rdquo; the girl hesitated, then went
on to say, &ldquo;Maybe I ought not to tell you the story
about the old place if you have any thought of living
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please tell it! Is it a ghost story?&rdquo; Bobs
begged, and Gloria added, &ldquo;Yes, do tell it, Miss
Selenski. We are none of us afraid of ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Miss Selenski agreed,
&ldquo;and, for that matter, neither am I. But nearly all
of our neighbors are superstitious. Mr. Tenowitz,
the grocer at the corner of First and Seventy-ninth
has the renting of the place, and he declares that the
last tenant rushed into his store early one morning,
paid his bill and departed without a word of explanation,
but he looked, Mr. Tenowitz told me, as
though he <i>had</i> seen a ghost. I don&rsquo;t think there is
anything the matter with the old house,&rdquo; their informant
continued, &ldquo;except just loneliness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, big, barnlike rooms, when they are
empty, echo every sound in a mournful manner
without supernatural aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did it all start?&rdquo; Bobs inquired. &ldquo;Did
anything of an unusual nature ever happen there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Selenski nodded, and then continued: &ldquo;The
story is that the only daughter of the last of the
Pensingers who lived there disappeared one night
and was never again seen. Her mother, so the tale
goes, wished her to marry an elderly English nobleman,
but she loved a poor Hungarian violinist whom
she was forbidden to see. Because of her grief, she
did many strange things, and one of them was to
walk at midnight, dressed all in white, along the
brink of the dark swirling river which edged the
wide lawn in front of her home. Her white silk
shawl was found on the bank one morning and the
lovely Marilyn Pensinger was never seen again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father, however, was convinced that his
daughter was not drowned, but that she had married
the man she loved and returned with him to his
native land, Hungary. So great was his faith in his
own theory that, in his will, he stated that the taxes
on the old Pensinger mansion should be paid for one
hundred years and that it should become the property
of any descendant of his daughter, Marilyn,
who could be found within that time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that will was made about seventy-five
years ago and so, you see, there are twenty-five years
remaining for an heir to turn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen if no one claims the old place?&rdquo;
Gloria inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to be sold and the money devoted to
charity,&rdquo; Miss Selenski told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly is an interesting yarn,&rdquo; Bobs declared;
then added gleefully, &ldquo;I suppose the people
around here think that the fair Marilyn returns at
midnight, prowling along the shores of the river
looking for her white silk shawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Selenski nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it, I believe.&rdquo;
Then she added brightly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, I&rsquo;m not
busy at this hour and if you wish I&rsquo;ll take you over
to see the old place. Mr. Tenowitz will give me the
keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Selenski,&rdquo; Gloria said. &ldquo;We
would be glad to have you show us the place. There
seems to be nothing else around here to rent and we
might remain in the Pensinger mansion until you
have a model flat unoccupied.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will not be soon,&rdquo; they were told, &ldquo;as there
is a long waiting list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after hanging a sign on the door which
stated that she would be gone for half an hour, Miss
Selenski and the three interested young people went
down Seventy-eighth Street and toward the East
River.</p>
<p>Bobs was hilariously excited. Perhaps, after all,
she was going to have an opportunity to really practice
what she had, half in fun, called her chosen
profession, for was there not a mystery to be solved
and an heir to be found?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">A STRANGE NEW HOME</span></h2>
<p>Lena May&rsquo;s clasp on the hand of her older sister
grew unconsciously tighter as they passed a noisy
tobacco factory which faced the East River and
loomed, smoke-blackened and huge.</p>
<p>The old Pensinger mansion was just beyond, set
far back on what had once been a beautiful lawn,
reaching to the river&rsquo;s edge, but which was now
hard ground with here and there a half-dead tree
struggling to live without care. A wide road now
separated it from the river, which was lined as far
up and down as one could see with wharves, to which
coal and lumber barges were tied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>The house did indeed look as though it were a
century old. The windows had never been boarded
up, and many of the panes had been broken by stones
thrown by the most daring of the street urchins,
though, luckily, few dared go near enough to further
molest the place for fear of stirring up the
&ldquo;haunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A noble house gone to decay,&rdquo; Gloria said. She
had to speak louder than usual because of the pounding
and whirring of the machinery in the neighboring
factory. Lena May wondered if anywhere in
all the world there were still peaceful spaces where
birds sang, or where the only sound was the murmuring
of the wind in the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it never still here?&rdquo; she turned big inquiring
eyes toward their guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Miss Selenski told her. &ldquo;That is, not
for more than a minute at a time, between shifts,
for when the day work stops the night work
begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the workers are women, are they not?&rdquo;
Gloria was looking at the windows of the factory
where many foreign women could be seen standing
at long tables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They leave their children at the Settlement
House. They work on the day shift, and the men,
if they can be made to work at all, go on at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gloria!&rdquo; this appealingly from the youngest,
&ldquo;will we ever be able to sleep in the midst of such
noise, when we have been used to such silent nights
at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much wonder that you ask,&rdquo; Bobs
laughingly exclaimed, as she thrust her fingers in
her ears, for at that moment a tug on the river, not
a stone&rsquo;s throw away from them, rent the air with a
shrill blast of its whistle, which was repeated time
and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind the noises when you get used
to them,&rdquo; Miss Selenski told them cheerfully. &ldquo;I
lived on Seventy-sixth Street, right under the Third
Avenue L, and the only time I woke up was when
the trains stopped running. The sudden stillness
startles one, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena May said nothing, but she was remembering
what Bobs had said when they had left the Third
Avenue Elevated: &ldquo;Now we are to see how the
&lsquo;other half&rsquo; lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor other half!&rdquo; the young girl thought. &ldquo;I
ought to be willing to live here for a time and bring
a little of the brightness I have known into their
lives, for they must be very drab.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait here a minute,&rdquo; Miss Selenski was saying,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll run over to the grocery and get the
key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was back in an incredibly short time and
found the three girls examining with great interest
the heavy front door, which had wide panels, a
shapely fan light over them, with beautiful emerald
glass panes on each side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply adore this knocker,&rdquo; Bobs declared,
jubilantly. &ldquo;Hark, let&rsquo;s hear the echoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knocker was lifted and dropped again, but
though they all listened intently, a sudden confusion
on the river made it impossible to hear aught else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My private opinion is that Marilyn&rsquo;s ghost
would much prefer some other spot for midnight
prowls,&rdquo; Bobs remarked, as the old key was being
fitted into the queerly designed lock. &ldquo;Imagine a
beautiful, sensitive girl of seventy-five years ago
trying to prowl down there where barges are tied to
soot-black docks and where derricks are emptying
coal into waiting trucks. No really romantic ghost,
such as I am sure Marilyn Pensinger must be, would
care to prowl around here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Miss Selenski smiled at Bobs&rsquo; nonsense. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad you feel that way,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for, of course,
if you don&rsquo;t believe in the ghost, you won&rsquo;t mind
renting the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the derrick of which Bobs had
spoken emptied a great bucket of coal with a deafening
roar, and a wind blowing from the river sent
the cloud of black dust hurling toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Duck inside!&rdquo; Bobs cautioned, as they
all leaped within and closed the door with a bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimminy-crickets!&rdquo; she then ejaculated, using
her favorite tom-boy expression. &ldquo;The man who
has this place to rent can&rsquo;t advertise it as clean and
quiet, a good place for nervous people to recuperate.&rdquo;
Then with a wry face toward her older
sister. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine Gwen in this house, can
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden troubled expression in
Gloria&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;No, dear, I can&rsquo;t. And I&rsquo;m wondering,
in fact I have often been wondering this
morning, if we ought not to select some place where
Gwen and little Lena May would be happier, for,
of course, Gwen <i>can&rsquo;t</i> keep on visiting her friends
forever. She will have to come home some day.&rdquo;
The speaker felt a hand slip into hers and, glancing
down, she saw a pleading in the uplifted eyes of
their youngest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d <i>like</i> to live here, Glow, for a
while, if you would.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Little self-sacrificing puss that you are.&rdquo; Gloria
smiled at Miss Selenski, then said: &ldquo;May we look
over the old house and decide if we wish to take it?
Time is passing and we have much packing to do if
we are to return in another day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although she did not say so, Bobs and Lena May
knew that their mothering sister was eager to return
to their Long Island home that she might see
Gwendolyn before her departure.</p>
<p>The old colonial mansion, like many others of its
kind, had a wide hall extending from the front to
the back. At the extreme rear was a fireplace with
built-in seats. In fact, to the great delight of Bobs,
who quite adored them, a fireplace was found in
each of the big barren rooms. Four of these were
on that floor, with the old kitchen in the basement,
and four vast silent rooms above, that had been bed
chambers in the long ago. Too, there was an attic,
which they did not visit.</p>
<p>When they had returned to the front hall, Bobs
exclaimed: &ldquo;We might rent just one floor of this
mansion and then have room to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>But the oldest sister looked dubious. &ldquo;I hardly
think it advisable to attempt to live in this place&mdash;&rdquo;
she began. &ldquo;There is enough room here to home
an orphanage, and the kiddies wouldn&rsquo;t be crowded,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta was plainly disappointed. &ldquo;Oh, I say,
Glow, haven&rsquo;t you always told us younger girls not
to make hasty conclusions, and here you have hardly
more than crossed the threshold and you have decided
that we couldn&rsquo;t make the old house livable.
Now, I think this room could be made real cozy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How the others laughed. &ldquo;Bobs, what a word
to apply to this old high-ceiled salon with its huge
chandeliers and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, girls,&rdquo; the irrepressible interrupted,
&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see all of those crystals sparkle
when the room is lighted?&rdquo; Then she confessed,
&ldquo;Perhaps cozy isn&rsquo;t exactly the right word, but
nevertheless I like the place, and now, with the door
closed, it isn&rsquo;t so noisy either. It&rsquo;s keen, take it
from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roberta,&rdquo; Gloria sighed, &ldquo;now and then I congratulate
myself that you have actually reformed in
your manner of speech, when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Glow, I&rsquo;ll make a bargain,&rdquo; Bobs again interrupted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk like the daughter of Old-dry-as-dust-Johnson,
if you&rsquo;ll take this place. Now, my
idea is that we can just furnish up this lower floor.
Make one of the back rooms into a kitchen and
dining-room, put in gas and electricity, and presto
change, there you are living in a modern up-to-date
apartment. Then we could lock up the basement
and the rooms upstairs and forget they are there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are permitted to forget,&rdquo; Miss Selenski
added, with her pleasant smile. Then, for the first
time, the girls remembered that the old house was
supposed to be supernaturally occupied.</p>
<p>It was Bobs who exclaimed: &ldquo;Well, if that poor
girl, Marilyn Pensinger, wants to come back here
now and then and prowl about her very own ancestral
mansion, I, for one, think we would be greatly
lacking in hospitality if we didn&rsquo;t make her welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then pleadingly to her older sister: &ldquo;Glow, be
a sport! Take it for a month and give it a try-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena May&rsquo;s big brown eyes wonderingly watched
this enthusiastic sister, who was but one year her
senior, but whose tastes were widely different. Her
gentle heart was already desperately homesick for
the old place on Long Island, for the gardens that
were a riot of flowers from spring until late fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Gloria walked to one of the windows and looked
out meditatively. &ldquo;If this is the only place in the
neighborhood in which we can live,&rdquo; she was thinking,
&ldquo;perhaps we would better take it, and, after all,
Bobs may be right: this one floor can be made real
homelike with the furniture that we will bring, and
what we do not need can be stored in the rooms
overhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs was eagerly awaiting her older sister&rsquo;s decision,
and when it was given, that hoidenish girl
leaped about the room, staging a sort of wild Indian
dance that must have amazed the two chandeliers
which had in the long ago looked down upon dignified
young ladies who solemnly danced the minuet,
and yet, perhaps the lonely old house was glad and
proud to think that it had been chosen as a residence
for three girls, and that once again its walls would
reverberate with laughter and song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must start for home at once,&rdquo; Gloria said.
Then, to Miss Selenski, &ldquo;We will stop on our way
to the elevated and tell Mr. Tenowitz that we will
take the place for a time; and thank you so much
for having helped us find something. We shall want
you to come often to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Bobs was the last one to leave, and before she
closed the heavy old-fashioned door, she peered back
into the musty dimness and called, &ldquo;Good-bye, old
house, we&rsquo;re going to have jolly good times, all of
us together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">A LOST SISTER</span></h2>
<p>Two weeks later many changes had taken place.
Mr. Tenowitz had agreed to have one of the two
large back rooms transformed into a modern kitchen
at one end, and the other end arranged so that it
might be used as a dining-room. In that room the
early morning sun found its way, and when Lena
May had filled the windows with boxes containing
the flowering plants brought from the home gardens,
it assumed a cheerfulness that delighted the
heart of the little housekeeper.</p>
<p>Too, the huge chandeliers in the salon had been
wired with electricity, and great was the joy in the
heart of Bobs on the night when they were first
lighted. The rich furnishings from their own drawing-room
were in place and the effect was far more
homelike than Gloria had supposed possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>The two large rooms on the other side of the
wide dividing hall had been fitted up as bed chambers
and the furniture that they did not need had
been stored in the large room over the kitchen.</p>
<p>How Lena May had dreaded that first night they
had spent in the old house, not because she believed
it to be haunted. Gloria had convinced her that
that could not possibly be so, but because of the
unusual noises, she knew that she would not be able
to sleep a wink. Nor was she, for each time that
she fell into a light slumber, a shriek from some
passing tug awakened her, and a dozen times at least
she seized her roommate, exclaiming, &ldquo;Glow, what
was that?&rdquo; Sometimes it was a band of hoodlums
passing, or again an early milk wagon, or some of
the many noises which accompanied the night activities
of the factory that was their next-door neighbor.</p>
<p>It was a very pale, sleepy-eyed Lena May who
set about getting breakfast the next morning, with
Gloria helping, but Bobs looked as refreshed as
though she had spent the night in her own room on
Long Island, where the whippoorwill was the only
disturber of the peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to it soon,&rdquo; that beaming maiden
told Lena May, and then, when the youngest girl
had gone with a small watering pot to attend to the
needs of her flower gardens at the front of the house,
Bobs added softly: &ldquo;Glow, how have you planned
things? It never would do to leave Lena May all
alone in the house, would it? And yet you and I
must go out and earn our daily bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take Lena May with me wherever I go;
that is, I will at first, until we have things adjusted,&rdquo;
the older sister replied. Then she inquired: &ldquo;What
do you intend to do, Bobsie, or is it a secret as yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is,&rdquo; was the laughing reply, &ldquo;a secret from
myself, as well as from everyone else, but I&rsquo;m going
to start out all alone into the great city of New York
this morning and give it the once over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roberta Vandergrift, didn&rsquo;t you promise me that
you would talk like a Johnsonian if we would rent
this house?&rdquo; Gloria reprimanded.</p>
<p>The irrepressible younger girl&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.
&ldquo;My revered sister,&rdquo; she said, solemnly, &ldquo;my plans
for the day are as yet veiled in mystery, but, with
your kind permission, I will endeavor to discover in
this vast metropolis some refined occupation, the
doing of which will prove sufficiently remunerative
to enable me to at least assist in the recuperation of
our fallen fortunes.&rdquo; Then rising and making a
deep bow, her right hand on her heart, that mischievous
girl inquired: &ldquo;Miss Vandergrift, shall I
continue conversing in that way during our sojourn
in this ancient mansion, or shall I be&mdash;just natural?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Lena May, who had returned, joined in the laughter,
and begged, &ldquo;Do be natural, Bobs, please, but
not too natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, mademoiselles, for your kind permission,
and now I believe I will don my outdoor
apparel and go in search of a profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gloria looked anxiously at the young girl before
her, who was of such a splendid athletic physique,
whose cheeks were ruddy with health, and whose
eyes were glowing with enthusiasm. Ought she to
permit Bobs to go alone into the great surging mass
of humanity so unprotected?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roberta,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;do not be too trusting,
dear. Remember that the city is full of dangers
that lurk in out-of-the-way places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger girl put both hands on the shoulders
of the oldest sister and, looking steadily into her
eyes, she said seriously: &ldquo;Glow, dear, you have
taught us that the greatest thing a parent can do
for her daughter is to teach her to be self-reliant that
she may stand alone as, sooner or later, she will
have to do. I shall be careful, as I do not wish to
cause my sisters needless worry or anxiety, but I
<i>must</i> begin to live my own life. You really wish
me to do this, do you not, Gloria?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and I am sure the
love of our mother will guide and guard you. Good-bye
and good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bobs was gone, Lena May slipped up to
the older sister, who had remained seated, and, putting
a loving arm over the strong shoulders, she
said tenderly: &ldquo;Glow, there are tears in your eyes.
Why? Do you mind Bobs&rsquo; going alone out into
the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of Mother, dear, and wishing
I could better take her place to you younger girls,
and too, I am worried, just a little, because Gwendolyn
does not write. It was a great sorrow to me,
Pet, to find that she had left without saying good-bye,
and I can&rsquo;t help but fear that I was hasty when
I told her that she must plan her life apart from us
if she could not be more harmonious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, rising, she added: &ldquo;Ah, well, things will
surely turn out for the best, little girl. Come now,
let us do our bit of tidying and then go over to the
Settlement House and find out what my hours are
to be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>But all that day, try as she might to be cheerful,
the mothering heart of Gloria was filled with anxiety
concerning her two charges. Would all be well with
the venturous Bobs, and why didn&rsquo;t Gwen write?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">BOBS SEEKS A PROFESSION</span></h2>
<p>There was no anxiety in the heart of Roberta.
In her short walking suit of blue tweed, with a
jaunty hat atop of her waving brown hair, she was
walking a brisk pace down Third Avenue. Even at
that early hour foreign women with shawls over
their heads and baskets on their arms were going
to market. It was a new experience to Roberta to
be elbowed aside as though she were not a descendant
of a long line of aristocratic Vandergrifts. The
fact that she was among them, made her one of
them, was probably their reasoning, if, indeed, they
noticed her at all, which she doubted. Gwen would
have drawn her skirts close, fearing contamination,
but not so Bobs. She reveled in the new experience,
feeling almost as though she were abroad in
Bohemia, Hungary or even Italy, for the dominant
nationality of the crowd changed noticeably before
she had gone many blocks. How wonderfully
beautiful were some of the young Italian matrons,
Bobs thought; their dark eyes shaded with long
lashes, their natural grace but little concealed by
bright-colored shawls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>At one corner where the traffic held her up, the
girl turned and looked at the store nearest, her attention
being attracted by a spray of lilacs that stood
within among piles of dusty old books. It seemed
strange to see that fragrant bit of springtime in a
gloomy second-hand shop so far from the country
where it might have blossomed. As Bobs gazed into
the shop, she was suddenly conscious of a movement
within, and then, out of the shadows, she saw forms
emerging. An old man with a long flowing beard
and the tight black skull cap so often worn by elderly
men of the East Side was pushing a wheeled chair
in which reclined a frail old woman, evidently his
wife. In her face there was an expression of suffering
patiently borne which touched the heart of the
young girl.</p>
<p>The chair was placed close to the window that the
invalid might look out at the street if she wished
and watch the panorama passing by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Instantly Bobs knew the meaning of the lilac, or
thought that she did, and, also, she at once decided
that she wished to purchase a book, and she groped
about in her memory trying to recall a title for
which she might inquire. A detective story, of
course, that was what she wanted. Since it was to
be her chosen profession, she could not read too
many of them.</p>
<p>The old man had disappeared by this time, but
when Bobs entered the dingy shop the woman smiled
up at her, and, to Roberta&rsquo;s surprise, she heard herself
saying, &ldquo;Oh, may I have just one little sniff of
your lilac? I adore them, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman in the chair nodded, and her reply
was in broken English, which charmed her listener.
She said that her &ldquo;good man&rdquo; bought her a &ldquo;blossom
by the flower shop&rdquo; every day, though she did
tell him he shouldn&rsquo;t, she knowing that to do it he
had to go without himself, but it&rsquo;s the only &ldquo;bit of
brightness he can be giving me,&rdquo; my good man says.</p>
<p>Then she was silent, for from a little dark room
at the back of the shop the old man, bent with years,
shuffled forward. Looking at him, Roberta knew
at once why he bought flowers and went without to
do it, for there was infinite tenderness in the eyes
that turned first of all to the occupant of the wheeled
chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Then he inquired what the customer might wish.
Roberta knew that she had a very small sum in her
pocket and that as yet she had not obtained work,
but buy something she surely must, so she asked for
detective stories.</p>
<p>The old man led her to a musty, dusty shelf and
there she selected several titles, paid the small sum
asked and inquired if he would keep the parcel for
her until she returned later in the day.</p>
<p>Then, with another bright word to the little old
woman, the girl was gone, looking back at the corner
to smile and nod, and the last thing that she saw was
the spray of lilacs that symbolized unselfish love.</p>
<p>With no definite destination in mind, Roberta
crossed Third Avenue and walked as briskly as the
throngs would permit in the direction of Fourth. In
a mood, half amused, half serious, she began to
soliloquize: &ldquo;Now, Miss Roberta Vandergrift, it is
high time that you were attempting to obtain employment
in this great city. Suppose you go over to
Fifth Avenue and apply for a position as sales girl
in one of the fine stores where you used to spend
money so lavishly?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>But, when the Fourth Avenue corner was reached,
Roberta stopped in the middle of the street heedless
of the seething traffic and stared at an upper window
where she saw a sign that fascinated her:</p>
<p class="center">BURNS FOURTH AVENUE BRANCH
<br />DETECTIVE AGENCY</p>
<p>The building was old and dingy, the stairway
rickety and dark, but Roberta in the spirit of adventure
climbed to the second floor without a thought
of fear. A moment later she was obeying a message
printed on a card that hung on the first door
in the unlighted hall which bade her enter and be
seated.</p>
<p>This she did and admitted herself into a small
waiting room beyond which were the private offices,
as the black letters on the frosted glass of a swinging
door informed her. Roberta sat down feeling
unreal, as though she were living in a story book.
She could hear voices beyond the door; one was
quiet and calm, the other high pitched and excited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>The latter was saying: &ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t want
no regular detective that any crook could get wise
to, I want someone so sort of stupid-looking that a
thief would think she wouldn&rsquo;t get on to it if he
lifted something right before her eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was harder for Roberta to hear the reply. However
she believed that it was: &ldquo;But, Mr. Queerwitz,
we only have one woman in our employ just now,
and she is engaged out of town. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker paused and looked up, for surely the
door to his private office had opened just a bit. Nor
was he mistaken, for Bobs, as usual, acting upon an
impulse, stood there and was saying: &ldquo;Pardon me
for overhearing your conversation. I just couldn&rsquo;t
help it. I came to apply for a position and I wondered
if I would do.&rdquo; There was a twinkle in her
eyes as she added: &ldquo;I can look real stupid if
need be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good-looking young man in the neat grey
tweed, arose, and his expression was one of appreciative
good humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not exactly according to Hoyle,&rdquo; he remarked
in his pleasant voice, &ldquo;but perhaps under the
circumstances it is excusable. May I know your
name and former occupation?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Roberta did a bit of quick mental gymnastics. She
did not wish to give her real name. A Vandergrift
in a Fourth Avenue detective agency! Even Gloria
might not approve of that. Almost instantly and
in a voice that carried conviction, at least to the older
man, the girl said: &ldquo;Dora Dolittle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Were the gray-blue eyes of the younger man
laughing? The girl could not tell, for his face was
serious and he continued in a more business-like
manner: &ldquo;Miss Dolittle, I am James Jewett. May
I introduce Mr. Queerwitz, who has a very fine shop
on Fifth Avenue, where he sells antiques of great
value? Although he has lost nothing as yet, he reports
that neighboring shops have been visited, presumably
by a woman, who departs with something
of value, and he wishes to be prepared by having in
his employ a clerk whose business it shall be to discover
the possible thief. Are you willing to undertake
this bit of detective work? If, at the end of
one week you have proved your ability in this line,
I will take you on our staff, as we are often in need
of a wide-awake young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was difficult for Roberta not to shout for joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Jewett,&rdquo; she replied as demurely
as a gladly pounding heart would permit. &ldquo;Shall
I go with Mr. Queerwitz now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and report to me each morning at eight
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>The two departed, although it was quite evident
that the merchant was not entirely pleased with the
arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Queerwitz! What a name!&rdquo; Bobs was soliloquizing
as she sat on the back seat of the big, comfortable
limousine, and now and then glanced at her
preoccupied companion. He was very rich, she decided,
but not refined, and yet how strange that a
man with unrefined tastes should wish to sell rarely
beautiful things and antiques. Mr. Queerwitz was
not communicative. In fact, he had tried to protest
at the suddenly made arrangement and had declared
to Mr. Jewett, in a brief moment when they were
alone, that he shouldn&rsquo;t pay a cent of salary to that
&ldquo;upstart of a girl&rdquo; unless she did something to really
earn it. Mr. Jewett had agreed, saying that he
would assume the responsibility; but of this Roberta
knew nothing.</p>
<p>They were soon riding down Fifth Avenue in the
throng of fine equipages with which she was most
familiar, as often the handsome Vandergrift car had
been one of the procession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Bobs felt that she would have to pinch herself as
she followed her portly employer into an exclusive
art shop to be sure that she was that same Roberta
Vandergrift. Then she reminded herself that she
must entirely forget her own name if she were to be
consistently Dora Dolittle.</p>
<p>How Bobs hoped that she would be successful on
this, her first case, that she might be permanently
engaged by that interesting looking young man who
called himself James Jewett.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">A NEW FRIEND</span></h2>
<p>At that early hour there were no customers in
the shop, but Roberta saw three young women of
widely varying ages who were dusting and putting
things in order for the business of the day. Mr.
Queerwitz went at once to a tall, spare woman of
about fifty whose light, reddish hair suggested that
the color had been applied from without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Peerwinkle,&rdquo; he said rather abruptly,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s the new clerk I was telling you about. You&rsquo;d
better show her the lay of things before it gets
busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Peerwinkle turned, and her washed-out blue
eyes seemed to look down at Roberta from the great
height where, at least, she believed that her position
as head saleslady at the Queerwitz antique shop had
placed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your name, Miss?&rdquo; she inquired when the proprietor
had departed toward a rear door labeled
&ldquo;No admittance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs had been so amused by all that she had seen
that she hardly heard the inquiry, and when at last
she did become conscious of it, for one wild moment
she couldn&rsquo;t recall her new name, and so she actually
hesitated. Luckily just then one of the girls called
to Miss Peerwinkle to ask her about a tag, and in
that brief moment Bobs remembered.</p>
<p>When the haughty &ldquo;head lady&rdquo; turned her coldly
inquiring eyes again toward the new clerk, Roberta
was able to calmly reply, &ldquo;Dora Dolittle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Peerwinkle sniffed. Perhaps she was thinking
it a poor name for an efficient clerk to possess.
Bobs&rsquo; sense of humor almost made her exclaim: &ldquo;I
ought to have chosen Dora Domuch.&rdquo; Then she
laughingly assured herself that <i>that</i> wouldn&rsquo;t have
done at all, as she did not believe that there <i>was</i> such
a name and surely she <i>had</i> heard of Dolittle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Bobs&rsquo; soliloquy was broken in upon by a strident
voice calling: &ldquo;Miss Dolittle, you&rsquo;re not paying
any attention to what I am saying. Right here and
now, let me tell you day-dreaming isn&rsquo;t permitted in
this shop. I was telling you to go with Nell Wiggin
to the cloakroom, and don&rsquo;t be gone more&rsquo;n five
minutes. Mr. Queerwitz don&rsquo;t pay salaries for
prinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs was desperately afraid that she wouldn&rsquo;t be
able to get through the morning without laughing,
and yet there was something tragic about the
haughtiness of this poor Miss Peerwinkle.</p>
<p>Meekly she followed a thin, pale girl of perhaps
twenty-three. The two who were left in the shop
at once began to express their indignation because
a new clerk had been brought in for them to train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever anybody looked the greenhorn, it&rsquo;s her,&rdquo;
Miss Peerwinkle exclaimed disdainfully, and Miss
Harriet Dingley agreed.</p>
<p>They said no more, for the new clerk, returning,
said, &ldquo;What am I to do first?&rdquo; Unfortunately
Roberta asked this of the one nearest, who happened
to be Miss Harriet Dingley. That woman actually
looked frightened as she said, nodding toward her
companion, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me. I&rsquo;m not head lady.
She is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Again Bobs found it hard not to laugh, for Miss
Peerwinkle perceptibly stiffened and her manner
seemed to say, &ldquo;You evidently aren&rsquo;t used to class
if you can&rsquo;t tell which folks are head and which
aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; But what she really said was: &ldquo;Nell Wiggin
will show you around, and do be careful you
don&rsquo;t knock anything over. If you do, your salary&rsquo;s
docked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be very careful, Miss Peerwinkle,&rdquo; the new
clerk said, but she was thinking, &ldquo;Docked! My salary
docked. I know what it is to dock a coal barge, for
I have one in front of my home, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dolittle, please do watch where you go.
You almost ran into that Venetian vase.&rdquo; There
was real kindness and concern in the voice of the
pale, very weary-looking young girl at her side, and
in that moment Bobs knew that she was going to
like her. &ldquo;Poor little thing,&rdquo; Bobs thought. &ldquo;She
looks as though some unkind Fate had put out the
light that ought to be shining in her heart. I wish
that I might find a way to rekindle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very patiently Miss Nell Wiggin explained the
different departments in the antique shop. Suddenly
she began to cough and sent a frightened glance
toward the closed door that bore the sign &ldquo;No
Admittance,&rdquo; then stifled the sound in her handkerchief.
Nothing was said, but Roberta understood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>The old furniture greatly interested Bobs. In her
own home there were many beautiful antiques.
Casually she inquired, &ldquo;How does Mr. Queerwitz
manage to obtain so much rare old furniture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her surprise, Nell Wiggin looked quickly
around to be sure that no one was near, then she
said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d ought not to tell you, but I will if you&rsquo;ll
keep it dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark as the deepest dungeon,&rdquo; Roberta replied,
much puzzled by her comrade&rsquo;s mysterious manner.
The slight girl drew close. &ldquo;He makes it behind
that door that nobody&rsquo;s allowed to go through,&rdquo; she
said in a low voice; then added, evidently wishing to
be fair, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s nothing unusual. Lots of dealers
make their antiques and the public goes on buying
them knowing they may not be as old as the tags
say. Here, now, are the old books, and at least they
are honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs uttered a cry of joy. &ldquo;Oh, how I do wish
I could have charge of this department,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I adore old books.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>There was a light in the pale face of little Miss
Wiggin. &ldquo;I do, too,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is, I love
Dickens; I never read much else.&rdquo; Then, almost
wistfully, she added: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have much chance
to go to school, but once, where I went to live, I
found an old set of Dickens&rsquo; books that someone
had left, and I&rsquo;ve just read them over and over.
I never go out nights and the people living in those
books are such a lot of company for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Bobs felt a yearning tenderness for this
frail girl, who was saying, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all the friends
I&rsquo;ve ever had, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsively the new clerk exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be your
friend, if you&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo; Just then a strident voice
called, &ldquo;Miss Wiggin, forward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay with the books,&rdquo; Nell said softly, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll do the china.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs watched the slight figure that was hurrying
toward the front, and she sighed, with tears close
to the hazel eyes, and in her heart was a prayer,
&ldquo;May I be forgiven for the selfish, heedless years
I have lived. But perhaps now I can make up for
it. Surely I shall try.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Roberta had been told by Mr. Jewett that she
must not reveal to anyone her real reason for being
at the antique shop, and, as Mr. Queerwitz had no
faith in the girl&rsquo;s ability to waylay a pilferer, he did
not care to have Miss Nell Wiggin devote more time
to teaching her the business of selling antiques. This
information was conveyed by Miss Peerwinkle to
Nell, who was told to stay away from the new clerk,
with the added remark: &ldquo;If she didn&rsquo;t get on to the
ropes with one hour&rsquo;s showing, she&rsquo;s too stupid for
this business, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why the head lady had taken such a very evident
dislike to her, Bobs could not understand, for surely
she was willing to do whatever she was told. Ah,
well, she wasn&rsquo;t going to worry. &ldquo;Worrying is what
makes one old,&rdquo; she thought, as she mounted a small
step-ladder on casters that one could push along the
shelves. From the top of it she examined the books
that were highest. Suddenly she uttered an exclamation
of delight, then looked about quickly to be
sure that she had not been heard. Customers in the
front part of the store occupied the attention of
the three clerks, so Roberta reached for a volume
that had attracted her attention. It was indeed rare
and old, so very old that she wondered that the covers
did not crumble, and it had illumined letters. &ldquo;Perhaps
they were made by early monks,&rdquo; Bobs was
thinking. She sat down on the ladder and began
turning the fascinating pages that were yellow with
age. Suddenly she was conscious that someone stood
near her. She looked up to find the accusing gaze
of the head clerk fixed upon her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Bobs was startled into exclaiming: &ldquo;Say, Miss
Peerwinkle, a cat has nothing on you when it comes
to walking softly, has it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reply was frigidly given: &ldquo;Miss Do-little,&rdquo;
with emphasis, &ldquo;you are supposed to dust the books,
not read them; and what&rsquo;s more, that particular book
is the rarest one in the whole collection. There&rsquo;s a
mate to it somewhere, and when Mr. Queerwitz finds
it, he can sell the two of them to Mr. Leonel Van
Loon for one thousand dollars in cool cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta was properly impressed, and replaced the
book; then, taking a duster, she proceeded to tidy
her department.</p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock Bobs wondered if she ought to
wander about the shop and watch the occasional
customer. This she did, and was soon in the
neighborhood of Miss Wiggin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to go out
to eat when I do,&rdquo; Nell told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Promptly at noon Miss Wiggin beckoned and
said: &ldquo;Come, Miss Dolittle, be as quick as you can.
We only have half an hour nooning, and every
minute counts. I go around to my room. You
might buy something, then come with me and eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta could hardly believe what she had heard.
&ldquo;Only half an hour to wash, go somewhere, eat your
lunch and get back?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the mad rush?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t
Mr. Queerwitz know there&rsquo;s all eternity ahead
of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wan smile was the only answer. Miss Nell
Wiggin was not wasting time. She led the way to
the cloakroom, donned her outdoor garments, and
then, taking her new friend by the hand, she said:
&ldquo;Hold fast to me. We&rsquo;ll take a short cut through
the back stockroom. It&rsquo;s black as soot in there when
it isn&rsquo;t lit up. Mr. Queerwitz won&rsquo;t let us burn
lights except for business reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs found herself being led through a room so
dark that she could barely see the two walls of boxes
that were piled high on either side, with a narrow
path between.</p>
<p>They soon emerged upon a back alley, where huge
cans of refuse stood, and where trucks were continually
passing up and down or standing at the
back entrances of stores loading and unloading.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now walk as fast as you can,&rdquo; little Miss Wiggin
said, as away she went toward Fourth Avenue,
with Roberta close behind her. If Bobs had known
what was going to happen that noon, she would not
have left the shop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">A HURRIED LUNCH</span></h2>
<p>Fourth Avenue having been reached, Miss
Wiggin darted into a corner delicatessen store.
&ldquo;What will you have for your lunch?&rdquo; she turned
to ask of her companion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get five
cents&rsquo; worth of hot macaroni and a dill pickle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Double the order,&rdquo; Bobs said, and then she added
to the man who stood behind the counter: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll also
take two ham sandwiches and two chocolate eclairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dolittle, isn&rsquo;t that too much for you
to spend at noon?&rdquo; This anxiously from pale,
starved-looking little Miss Wiggin.</p>
<p>At the Vandergrift table there had always been
many courses with a butler to serve, and in her heedless,
thoughtless way, Bobs had supposed that everyone,
everywhere, had enough to eat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>It was a queer little smile that she turned toward
her new friend as she replied: &ldquo;This being our first
lunch together, let&rsquo;s have a spread.&rdquo; Then she paid
the entire bill, which came to forty cents. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
she assured the protesting Nell Wiggin, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
offer to treat every day. After this we&rsquo;ll go Dutch,
honest we will! Now lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again in the thronged street, little Miss Wiggin
turned with an apology: &ldquo;Maybe I oughtn&rsquo;t to&rsquo;ve
asked you to come to my room. Probably you&rsquo;re
used to something better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it!&rdquo; Bobs replied cheerily. &ldquo;I
live in the shabbiest kind of a dump.&rdquo; She did not
add that she had not as yet resided on New York&rsquo;s
East Side for more than twenty-four hours, at the
longest, and that prior to that her home on Long
Island had been palatial. She was eager to know
how girls who had never had a chance were forced
to live. Miss Wiggin was descending rather rickety
steps below the street level. &ldquo;Is your room in the
basement?&rdquo; Bobs asked, trying to keep from her
voice the shock that this revelation brought to her.
No wonder there were no roses in the wan cheeks
of little Miss Wiggin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;the caretakers of the
buildings all live in the basements, you know, and
Mrs. O&rsquo;Malley, the janitor of this one, is a widow
with two little boys. She had a room to rent cheap
and so I took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she led the way through a long, narrow,
dark hall. Once Bobs touched the wall and she
drew back shuddering, for the stones were cold and
clammy.</p>
<p>The little room to which Bobs was admitted
opened only on an air shaft, but there was sunlight
entering its one small window; too, there were white
curtains and a geranium in bloom on the sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always pleasantest at noon, for that&rsquo;s the
only time that the sun reaches my window,&rdquo; the
little hostess said, as she hurriedly drew a sewing
table out from behind the small cot bed, unfolded it
and placed the lunch thereon. Bobs&rsquo; gaze wandered
about the room, which was so small that its three
pieces of furniture seemed to crowd it. In one
corner was a bamboo bookcase which held the real
treasure of Miss Wiggin. Row after row of books
in uniform dark red binding. They were all there&mdash;Oliver
Twist, David Copperfield, Old Curiosity Shop
and the rest of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nights it would be sort of dismal sitting in here
alone if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t for those books,&rdquo; the little hostess
confessed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a real good kerosene lamp I have.
It makes a bright light. I curl up on the couch as
soon as my supper&rsquo;s eaten, and then I forget where
I really am, for I go wherever the story takes me.
Come, everything is ready,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and since
fifteen minutes of our time is gone already, we&rsquo;d
better eat without talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This they did, and Gloria would have said that
they gulped their food, but what can one do with
but half an hour for nooning?</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even stop to put away the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
leave it ready for my supper tonight,&rdquo; Miss Wiggin
said, as she fairly flew down the dark, damp basement
hall.</p>
<p>Five minutes later they were entering the alley
door of the antique shop which had so fine an entrance
on Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the Fates save us!&rdquo; Bobs exclaimed. &ldquo;I do
believe we are one minute late. Are we in for execution
or dismissal?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>But that one minute had evidently escaped the
watchful eye of Miss Peerwinkle, for, when Nell
Wiggin and Roberta entered the shop, they saw the
portly Mr. Queerwitz pacing up and down and in
tragic tones he was exclaiming: &ldquo;Gone! Gone!
I should have locked it up, but I didn&rsquo;t think anyone
else knew the value of it.&rdquo; Then, wheeling around,
he demanded of Bobs: &ldquo;What good are you, anyway,
in the book department? One of the rarest
books I possess was stolen this morning right beneath
your very eyes, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Nell Wiggin, usually so timid, stepped forward
and said: &ldquo;It must have happened while we
were out at lunch. It couldn&rsquo;t have been while we
were here, for nobody at all went down to the
books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Queerwitz paid no more attention to the
words of little Miss Wiggin than he would at that
moment to the buzzing of a fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dolittle, well-named, I should say,&rdquo; he remarked
scathingly. How Roberta wished that she had
chosen a busier sounding name, but the deed was
done. One couldn&rsquo;t be changing one&rsquo;s name every
few hours, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Her revery was interrupted by: &ldquo;What have you
to say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; was the honest reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are discharged,&rdquo; came the ultimatum.</p>
<p>Bobs was almost glad. &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Queerwitz,&rdquo;
she replied, and turning, she walked briskly
toward the cloakroom.</p>
<p>When Bobs returned from the cloakroom, having
donned her hat and jacket, she was informed that
Mr. Queerwitz had just driven away, but that he
hadn&rsquo;t said where he was going. Bobs believed that
he was going to report her uselessness as a detective
to her employer, James Jewett. Ah, well, let him
go. Perhaps after all she had made a mistake in
her choice of a profession. As she was passing she
heard the older women talking.</p>
<p>Miss Harriet Dingley was saying, &ldquo;Now I come
to think of it, just after the girls went out to lunch,
I did see a man come in, but I thought he was looking
at china.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The head lady shot a none too pleasant glance at
the other clerk as she said coldly, &ldquo;Well, you aren&rsquo;t
giving me any information. Didn&rsquo;t I watch every
move he made like a cat watches a mouse hole? Just
tell me that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Miss Peerwinkle. I&rsquo;m not criticizing
anything you did. But you remember when a boy
ran by shouting fire, we did go to the door to see
where the fire was and a minute later the man went
out and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went empty-handed,&rdquo; the head-woman said
self-defendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he did. Now please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
criticizing you, but when he went out I noticed that
he was a hunch-back, and I&rsquo;m certain that he didn&rsquo;t
have a hump when he came in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not discuss the matter further,&rdquo; was said
in a tone of finality as Miss Peerwinkle walked away
with an air of offended dignity.</p>
<p>Bobs looked about for Nell, to whom she wished
to say good-bye. She was glad that the youngest
clerk was beyond the book shelves as Roberta was
curious to know which book had been taken. A gap
on the top shelf told the story. It was a rare old
book for which one thousand dollars had been offered
if its mate could be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever has taken the book has the other
volume. I&rsquo;m detective enough to know that,&rdquo; Roberta
declared. Then she turned to find little Miss Wiggin
standing at her side looking as sad as though something
very precious was being taken away from her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Impulsively Bobs held out both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, Nell Wiggin, that you and I are to
be friends, and what&rsquo;s more, next Sunday morning
at ten o&rsquo;clock sharp I&rsquo;m coming down to get you and
take you to my home for dinner. How would you
like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it?&rdquo; The dark eyes in the pale, wan face
were like stars. &ldquo;O, Miss Dolittle, what it will mean
to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Harriet Dingley did nod when she heard
Bobs singing out &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; but Miss Peerwinkle
seemed to be as deaf as a statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could laugh,&rdquo; Bobs said to herself as she joined
the throng on Fifth Avenue, &ldquo;if my heart wasn&rsquo;t so
full of tears. I don&rsquo;t know as I can stand much
more of seeing how the other half lives without
having a good cry over it. Dickens, the only friend
and comforter of that frail little mite of humanity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as she turned again toward Avenue A, she
suddenly remembered the package of detective stories
for which she had promised to call at the shop where
there was a spray of lilacs and a much-loved invalid
woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll give up the detective game,&rdquo; she
thought, as she hurried along, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll enjoy reading
the stories just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later she had changed her mind and
had decided that she really was a very fine detective
indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">BOBS AS BOOKSELLER</span></h2>
<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when Bobs
entered the musty book shop on the East Side and
found the place unoccupied. However, the tinkling
of a bell sounded in the back room and the little old
man shuffled in. His expression was troubled, and
when Roberta inquired for his invalid wife, he replied
that she wasn&rsquo;t so well. &ldquo;Poor Marlitta,&rdquo; he
said, and there was infinite tenderness in his voice,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s yearning to go back to the home country
where our children are and their children, and the
doctor thinks it might make her strong once again
to be there, but the voyage costs money, and Marlitta
would rather die here than not go honest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>The old man seemed to be overcome with emotion,
then suddenly recalling his customer&rsquo;s errand, he
shuffled away to procure the package of detective
stories for which she had called. During his absence
Roberta went back of the counter, reached for a book
on an upper shelf and, while so doing, dislodged
several others that tumbled about her, revealing, as
though it had been hidden in the dark recess back
of them, the rare book which that morning had been
taken from the Queerwitz Antique Shop.</p>
<p>That, then, was what the old man meant when he
said that his Marlitta would not go unless she could
&ldquo;go honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl quickly replaced the books and then stood
deep in thought. What could she do? What should
she do? She knew that the gentle bookseller had
taken the rare volume merely to try to save the life
of the one dearest to him. When he returned with
the package the girl heard herself asking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you, if your Marlitta went to the home country,
would you not be very lonely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was infinite sadness in the faded eyes and
yet, too, there was something else, a light from the
soul that true sacrifice brings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that I also might go,&rdquo; he said; then with a
gesture that included all of the small dark shop, he
added, &ldquo;but these old books are all I have and they
do not sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Roberta recalled the name of
Lionel Van Loon, who, as Miss Peerwinkle had
assured her, would pay one thousand dollars for the
rare book and its mate. For a thoughtful moment
the girl gazed at the lilac, then decided to tell the
little old man all that she knew.</p>
<p>At first she regretted this decision when she saw
the frightened expression in his gentle, child-like
face, but she hastened to assure him that she only
wanted to help him, and so she was asking him to
send the stolen book back to the antique shop by
mail.</p>
<p>When this had been done, Roberta, returning
from the corner post box, found the old man gazing
sadly at another volume which the girl instantly
knew was the prized mate of the one she had just
mailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use without the other,&rdquo; the bookseller told
her, &ldquo;and Mr. Queerwitz wouldn&rsquo;t pay what it&rsquo;s
worth. He never does. He crowds the poor man
to the wall and then crushes him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have a plan,&rdquo; the girl told him. &ldquo;Will you
trust me with this book for a little while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trust her? Who would not? For reply the old
man held his treasure toward her. &ldquo;Heaven bless
you,&rdquo; was all that he said.</p>
<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock when Bobs descended from a
taxicab and mounted the steps of a handsome brown
stone mansion on Riverside Drive. Mr. Van Loon
was at home and, being a most kindly old gentleman
and accustomed to receiving all manner of
persons, he welcomed Roberta into his wonderful
library, listened courteously at first, but with growing
interest, when he realized that this radiant girl
had a book to sell which she believed to be both rare
and valuable. The eyes of the cultured gentleman
plainly revealed his great joy when he actually saw
the long-sought first volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you cannot know
what it means to me to be able to obtain that book.
I know where I can find its mate and so, I assure
you, I will purchase it, the price being?&mdash;&rdquo; He
paused inquiringly.</p>
<p>Roberta heard, as though it were someone else
speaking, her own voice saying: &ldquo;Would one thousand
dollars be too much, Mr. Van Loon?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>To a man whose hobby was collecting books, and
who was many times a millionaire, it was not too
much. &ldquo;Will you have cash or a check?&rdquo; he
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cash, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was six o&rsquo;clock when Bobs handed the money
to the overjoyed bookseller, who could not thank her
enough. The little old woman again was by the
window and she smiled happily as she listened to
the words of the girl that fairly tumbled over each
other in their eagerness to be spoken.</p>
<p>Then reaching out a frail hand to her &ldquo;good
man,&rdquo; and looking at him with a light in her eyes
that Bobs would never forget, she said: &ldquo;Caleb, now
we can both go home to our children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta promised to return the following day to
help them prepare for the voyage. She was turning
away when the little woman called to her: &ldquo;I
want you to have my lilac,&rdquo; she said, as she held
the blossoming spray toward the girl.</p>
<p>It was half past six o&rsquo;clock when Bobs reached
home. Gloria was watching for her rather anxiously,
but it was not until they were gathered about
the fireplace for the evening that Bobs told her
story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here endeth my experience as a detective,&rdquo; she
concluded.</p>
<p>But Roberta was mistaken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">A QUEER GIFT</span></h2>
<p>True to her promise Roberta had gone on the
following afternoon to assist her new friends to
prepare for their voyage, but to her amazement she
found that they had departed, but the janitress living
in the basement was on the watch for the girl and
at once she ascended the stone stairs and inquired:
&ldquo;Are you Miss Dolittle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs replied that she was, and the large woman,
in a manner which plainly told that she had a message
of importance to convey, whispered mysteriously,
&ldquo;Wait here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down into the well of a stairway she disappeared,
soon to return with an envelope containing something
hard, which felt as though it might be a key.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>This it proved to be. The writing in the letter
had been painstakingly made, but the language was
not English, and Bobs looked at it with so frankly
puzzled an expression that the woman, who had been
standing near, watching curiously, asked: &ldquo;Can I
read it for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange things surely had happened since the Vandergrifts
had gone to the East Side to live, but this
was the strangest of all. It was hard for Roberta
to believe that she heard aright. The old man had
written that his entire stock was worth no more
than five hundred dollars, and since Roberta had
procured more than that sum for him, he was making
her a gift of the books that remained, and requested
that she remove them at once, as the rent on
the shop would expire the following day.</p>
<p>The janitress, with an eye to business, at once said
that her son, Jacob, was idle and could truck the
books for the young lady wherever she wished them
to go. It was two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when this
conversation took place, and at five o&rsquo;clock Gloria
and Lena May, returning from the Settlement
House, were amazed to see a skinny horse drawing
a two-wheeled ash cart stopping at the curb in front
of the Pensinger mansion. The driver was a
Hebrew lad, but at his side sat no less a personage
than Roberta, who beamed down upon her astonished
sisters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>After a moment of explanation the three girls
assisted the boy Jacob to cart all the books to one
of the unoccupied upper rooms, and when he had
driven away Roberta sank down upon a kitchen
chair and laughed until she declared that she ached.
Lena May, busy setting the table for supper, merrily
declared: &ldquo;Bobs, what a girl you are to have adventures.
Here Glow and I have been on the East Side
just as long as you have, and nothing unusual has
happened to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it time,&rdquo; Roberta remarked as she rose to
wash her hands. &ldquo;But now I seem to have had a
new profession thrust upon me. Glow, how would
it do to open an old book shop out on the front
lawn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prophesy that these books will fill a good need
some day, perhaps, when we&rsquo;re least expecting it,&rdquo;
was Gloria&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Then, as they sat eating their evening meal together
and watching the afterglow of the sunset on
the river, that was so near their front door, at last
Bobs said: &ldquo;Do see those throngs of poor tired-out
women trooping from the factory. Now they will
go to the Settlement House and get their children, go
home and cook and wash and iron and darn and&mdash;&rdquo;
she paused, then added, &ldquo;How did we four girls ever
manage to live so near all this and know nothing
about it? I feel as though I had been the most
selfish, useless, good-for-nothing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, here, young lady. I won&rsquo;t allow you to
call my sister such hard names,&rdquo; Glow said merrily
as she rose to replenish their cups of hot chocolate.
Then, more seriously, she added as she reseated herself:
&ldquo;Losing our home seemed hard, but I do believe
that we three are glad that something happened
to make us of greater use in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Lena May said, looking up brightly. She
was thinking of the sandpile at the Settlement House
over which she had presided that afternoon.</p>
<p>And Gloria concluded: &ldquo;I know that I would be
more nearly happy than I have been since our mother
died, if only I knew where Gwendolyn is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And where was Gwendolyn, the proud, selfish girl
who had not tried to make the best of things? Gloria
would indeed have been troubled had she but known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">A YOUNG MAN ENTERS</span></h2>
<p>It was early Sunday morning. &ldquo;Since we are to
have your little friend, Nell Wiggin, to dinner today,&rdquo;
Gloria remarked as the three sat at breakfast,
&ldquo;suppose we also invite Miss Selenski. It will be a
nice change for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Bobs agreed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a splendid suggestion.
Now what is the program for the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lena May has consented to tell Bible stories to
the very little children each Sunday morning at the
Settlement House,&rdquo; Gloria said, &ldquo;and I have asked
a group of the older girls who are in one of my
clubs to come over here this afternoon for tea and
a quiet hour around the fireplace. I thought it would
be a pleasant change for them, and I want you girls
to become acquainted with them so when I mention
their names you will be able to picture them. They
really are such bright, attractive girls! The Settlement
House is giving them the only chance that life
has to offer them.&rdquo; Then, smiling lovingly at the
youngest, Gloria concluded: &ldquo;Lena May has consented
to pour, and you, Bobs, I shall expect to
provide much of the entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Roberta laughed. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What am
I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, just be natural.&rdquo; Gloria rose and began to
clear the table as she added: &ldquo;Now, Bobs, since you
have to go after your friend, Miss Wiggin, Lena
May and I will prepare the dinner. We have it
planned, but we&rsquo;re going to surprise you with our
menu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nine o&rsquo;clock when Roberta left the Pensinger
mansion. It was the first Sunday that the
girls had spent on the East Side, and what a different
sight met the eyes of Bobs when she started down
the nearly deserted street, on one side of which were
the wide docks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Derricks were silent and the men who lived on
the barges were dressed in whatever holiday attire
they possessed. They were seated, some on gunwales,
others on rolls of tarred rope, smoking and
talking, and save for an occasional steamer loaded
with folk from the city who were sailing away for
a day&rsquo;s outing, peace reigned on the waterfront, for
even the noise of the factory was stilled.</p>
<p>Turning the corner at Seventy-eighth Street,
Roberta was surprised to find that the boys&rsquo; playground
was nearly deserted. She had supposed that
at this hour it would be thronged. Just as she was
puzzling about it, a lad with whom she had a speaking
acquaintance emerged from a doorway and she
hailed him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all dressed up, Antovich, aren&rsquo;t you?
Just like a regular little gentleman. Are you going
to Sunday school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, ma&rsquo;am; that is, I donno as &rsquo;tis. Mr.
Hardinian doesn&rsquo;t go to call it that. He calls it a
boys&rsquo; club by Treasure Seekers. There&rsquo;s a clubhouse
over to Seventy-fifth Street. I say, Miss
Bobs, I wish for you to come and see it. I sure
wish for you to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta assured the eager lad that she might look
in a little later, then bidding him good-bye, she
turned in to the model tenement house to ask Miss
Selenski to a one o&rsquo;clock dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely and sunny and sweet smelling
your little home is,&rdquo; Bobs said three minutes later
when she had been admitted to the small apartment,
the front windows of which overlooked the glistening
blue river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; was the bright reply of the slender
dark-eyed girl who lived there.</p>
<p>Bobs continued: &ldquo;How I wish the rich folk who
built this would influence others to do the same.
Take that rookery across the street, for instance. It
looks as though a clap of thunder would crash it to
the ground, and it surely is a fire trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed that,&rdquo; Miss Selenski said, &ldquo;and
though I have reported it time and again, the very
rich man who owns it finds it such excellent income
property that he manages to evade an injunction to
have the place torn down. Some day we&rsquo;ll have a
terrible tragedy of some kind over there, and then
perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; she paused and sighed. &ldquo;But, since we
can&rsquo;t help, let&rsquo;s talk of pleasanter things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Bobs then informed Miss Selenski that she had
come to invite her to dinner that day, and the little
agent of the model apartments indeed was pleased,
and replied: &ldquo;Some time soon I shall invite you girls
over here and give you just Hungarian dishes.&rdquo;
Then Bobs departed, and as she walked down Fourth
Avenue she glanced with rather an amused expression
up at the windows of the Detective Agency of
which, for so brief a time, she had been an employee.
She wondered what that good-looking young man,
James Jewett, had thought of her, for, surely, her
recent employer would have at once telephoned that
as a detective she had been &ldquo;no good.&rdquo; Then she
decided that she probably never would learn, as she
most certainly would not again return to the agency.
But little do we know what fate holds in store for us.</p>
<p>Nell Wiggin was ready and waiting, and she
looked very sweet indeed, with her corn yellow hair
fluffed beneath her neat blue hat, her eyes eager, her
cheeks, usually pale, flushed with this unusual excitement.
Her suit was neat and trim, though made of
cheap material.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right on time to the very minute, aren&rsquo;t
you, Miss Dolittle?&rdquo; she said happily, as she opened
the door to admit her new friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I sure am,&rdquo; was the bright reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the original
on the dot man, or young lady, I should say.&rdquo;
But while Bobs was speaking there was misgivings
in her heart. She had forgotten to ask Gloria what
she ought to do about her name. Should they all
be Dolittles or Vandergrifts? She decided to take
Nell into her confidence and tell her the story of the
assumed name.</p>
<p>The listener did not seem at all surprised. &ldquo;Lots
of girls who go out to work change their names,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as honest as writing stories
under a different name, I should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Roberta agreed, much relieved. &ldquo;A
nom-de-plume isn&rsquo;t much different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you are a detective?&rdquo; Nell looked at her
friend with a little more awe, perhaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens no! Not now!&rdquo; Bobs was quick to
protest. &ldquo;I merely tried it, and failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as it turned out, a detective wasn&rsquo;t needed
on that particular case.&rdquo; Nell was giving Bob the
very information she was eager to receive, but for
which she did not wish to ask. &ldquo;The next day the
stolen book came back by mail.&rdquo; Roberta knew that
she ought to register astonishment, but instead, she
laughed. &ldquo;What did Mr. Queerwitz say?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they all put it down to conscience. That
does happen, you know. You read about conscience
money being returned every now and then in the
newspapers, but the strangest part was, that that
very afternoon Mr. Van Loon came in and said
that he had been able to obtain the first volume and
wished to purchase the second. Mr. Queerwitz was
out at the time, and so Miss Peerwinkle sold it to
him for five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs wanted to laugh again. It amused her to
think that she had driven the better bargain, but she
thought it unwise to appear too interested in the
transaction, and so she changed the subject, and
together they walked up Third Avenue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How different it all is on Sunday,&rdquo; Nell Wiggin
smiled happily at her new friend. She had indeed
spoken truly. The vendors&rsquo; carts were conspicuous
by their absence and the stores, if they were open,
seemed to be more for the social gathering of foreign
folk dressed in their gay best, than for active
business. Even the elevated trains thundered overhead
with much longer intervals in between, and
sometimes, for as long as fifteen minutes, the peace
of Sunday seemed to pervade that unlovely East
Side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>Bobs, noting a Seventy-fifth Street sign, stopped
and gazed down toward the river, and sure enough
she saw a long, low building labeled Boys&rsquo; Club
House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go through this way to Second,&rdquo; Bobs
suggested. In front of the clubhouse there was a
group of boys with faces so clean that they shone,
and one of these, leaving the others, raced up to the
girls, and taking his friend by the hand, he said:
&ldquo;Oh, Miss Bobs, you did for to come, didn&rsquo;t you?
Please stop in by the clubhouse. It will to please
Mr. Hardinian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta&rsquo;s smile seemed to convey consent, and she
found herself being rapidly led toward a wide-open
door. Nell willingly followed. The sound of band
practice came from within, but, when the lad appeared
with the smiling guest, a young man, who
had been playing upon a flute, arose and at once
advanced toward them. What dark, beautiful eyes
he had! &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Roberta exclaimed in surprise.
&ldquo;We saw Mr. Hardinian the very first day we came
in this neighborhood to live. He was helping a
poor sick woman who had fallen, and&mdash;&rdquo; But she
could say no more, for the small boy was eagerly
telling the clubmaster that this was his &ldquo;lady friend&rdquo;
and that her name was Miss Bobs. The young man
smiled and said that he was always glad to have
visitors. &ldquo;What a musical voice!&rdquo; was Bobs&rsquo; thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Then, turning to the girl who had remained by
the open door, she held out a hand. &ldquo;This is my
friend, Nell Wiggin. I am sure that we will both
be interested in knowing of your work, Mr. Hardinian,
if you have time to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have, always, for those who are interested.&rdquo;
Then the young man told them of his many
clubs for boys.</p>
<p>Roberta looked about with interest. &ldquo;Why are
there so many wide shelves all around the walls, Mr.
Hardinian?&rdquo; she asked at last.</p>
<p>The young man smiled. &ldquo;If you will come some
night at ten o&rsquo;clock you will find a little street urchin,
some homeless little fellow, tucked up in blankets
asleep on each of those shelves, as you call their
bunks. Maybe you do not know, but even in the
bitterest winter weather many small boys sleep out
in the streets or creep into doorways and huddle
together to keep warm. That is, they used to before
I came. Now they are all welcome in here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Roberta wished she might ask this wonderful
young man where he came from, but that would not
do on so slight an acquaintance, and so thanking
him and bidding him good morning, with Nell and
Antovich, she again started for home.</p>
<p>Though Roberta little dreamed it, the wonderful
young man had come into the drama of their lives,
and was to play a very important part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">NELL WIGGIN&rsquo;S STORY</span></h2>
<p>Such a merry dinner party as it was in one corner
of the big southeast corner room of the old Pensinger
mansion. The young hostesses by neither word
nor manner betrayed the fact that they were used to
better things. When at last the dishes had been
washed and put away, a fire was started on the wide
hearth in the long salon and the girls gathered
about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we each tell the story of our lives,&rdquo;
Gloria suggested, &ldquo;and in that way we may the
sooner become really acquainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ourselves a few words will suffice. We
three girls lived very happily in our Long Island
home until our dear mother died; then, last year,
our beloved father was taken, and since then I, because
I am oldest, have tried to be both parents to
my younger sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And truly you have succeeded,&rdquo; Bobs put in.
Gloria smiled lovingly at her hoidenish sister, who
sat on a low stool close to the fire, her arms folded
about her knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we soon found that in reality the roof that
had sheltered us from childhood was not really our
own. The title, it seems, had not been clear in the
very beginning, when our great-grandfather had
purchased it, and so, because of this, we had to
move. I wanted to do settlement work, and that is
what I am doing now. Lena May also loves the
work, and is soon to have classes for the very little
boys and girls. Bobs, as we call this tom-boy sister
of ours, as yet, I believe, has not definitely decided
upon a profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta&rsquo;s eyes were laughing as she glanced
across at Nell Wiggin, but since Miss Selenski did
not know the story of her recent adventure, nothing
was said.</p>
<p>Turning to the slender, dark-eyed agent of the
model tenements, Gloria remarked: &ldquo;Will you now
tell us a little about yourself, Miss Selenski?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>All through the dinner hour the girls had noticed
a happy light that seemed to linger far back in the
nearly black orbs of the Hungarian girl, but they
thought it was her optimistic nature that gladdened
her eyes; but now, in answer to Gloria&rsquo;s question,
the dark, pretty face became radiant as the girl replied:
&ldquo;The past holds little worth the telling, but
the future, I believe, will hold much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Selenski,&rdquo; Bobs exclaimed, leaning
forward eagerly and smiling at their Hungarian
friend, &ldquo;something wonderful is about to happen in
your life, I am sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shining-eyed, the dark girl nodded. &ldquo;Do you
want to guess what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Lena May who answered: &ldquo;I think you
are going to be married,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; was the joyfully given reply. &ldquo;To a young
man from my own country who has a business in
the Bronx; nor is that all, he owns a little home
way out by the park and there is a real yard about
it with flowers and trees. Oh, can you understand
what it will mean to me to be awakened in the morning
by birds instead of by the thundering noise of
overhead trains?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Selenski,&rdquo; Gloria said, &ldquo;we are glad indeed
that such a happy future awaits you.&rdquo; Then turning
to little Nell Wiggin, who sat back somewhat
in the shadow, though now and then the flickering
firelight changed her corn-yellow hair to a halo of
golden sheen, she asked kindly: &ldquo;Is there some bit
of your past that you wish to tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something so infinitely sorrowful in
the pale pinched face of little Nell Wiggin that instinctively
the girls knew that the story they would
hear would be sad, nor were they mistaken.</p>
<p>Nell Wiggin began: &ldquo;It is not interesting, my
past, and I fear that it is too sad for a story, but
briefly I will tell it: My twin brother, Dean, and I
were born on a farm in New England which seemed
able to produce but little on its rocky soil, and
though our father managed to keep us alive, he could
not pay off the mortgage, and each year he grew
more troubled in spirit. At last he heard of rich
lands in the West that might be homesteaded and
so, leaving us one spring, he set out on foot, for he
planned taking up a claim, and when he had constructed
there a shelter of some kind, Mother was
to sell the New England farm, pay off the mortgage
and with whatever remained buy tickets that would
take us west to my father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was May when he left us. He did not expect
to reach his destination for many weeks, as he
knew that he would have to stop along the way to
work for his food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little Mother tried to run the farm that
summer. Dean and I were ten years of age, and
though we could do weeding and seeding, we could
not help with the heavier work, and since our mother
was frail much of this had to be left undone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fate was against us, it would seem, for the rain
was scarce and our crops poor, and the bitterly cold
winter found us with but little provisions in store.
In all this time we had not heard from Father, and
after the snows came we knew the post office in the
town twenty miles away could not be reached by us
until the following spring, and so we could neither
receive nor send a letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our nearest neighbor was eight miles away, and
he was but a poor scrabbler in the rocky soil, a kind-hearted
hermit of whom Brother and I had at first
been afraid, because of his long bushy beard, perhaps,
but when we once chanced to be near enough
to see his kind gray eyes, we loved him and knew
that he was a friend, and the future surely was to
prove this. But, if possible, that dear old man, Mr.
Eastland, was poorer than we were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our mother, we knew, was worried nearly to the
point of heartbreak, but I shall never forget how
wonderful she was that winter. Whenever we looked,
she smiled at us, tremulously sometimes, and when
our task of shelling and pounding corn was over,
she helped us invent little games and told us beautiful
stories that she made up. But for all her outward
cheer, I now realize, when we children were asleep
on the mattress that had been brought from the cold
bedroom and placed on the floor near the stove, that
our mother spent many long hours on her knees in
prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our cow had been sold before the snow came,
as money had been needed to pay on the mortgage,
and so we had no milk. Our few hens were kept in
a lean-to shed during the day, but Mother permitted
them to roost behind the stove on those bitterly cold
nights, and so occasionally we had eggs, and a rare
feast it was, but at last our supply of corn was nearly
exhausted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was usually a thaw in January, but instead,
this exceptionally cold winter brought a blizzard
which continued day after day, burying our
house deep in snow. At last Mother had to tell us
that unless a thaw came that we might procure some
provisions from our neighbors, we would have to
kill our three hens for food. What we would do
after that, she did not say; but, luckily, for the
feathered members of our family, the thaw did come
and with it came Mr. Eastland, riding the eight miles
on his stout little mule, and fastened to the saddle,
back of him, was a bag of corn and potatoes. Dear,
kind man! He must have brought us half of his
own remaining store. Eagerly our mother asked if
there had been news from town, but he shook his
head. &lsquo;No one&rsquo;s been through with the mail, Mis&rsquo;
Wiggin,&rsquo; he said; then he added: &lsquo;I s&rsquo;pose likely
you&rsquo;re powerful consarned about that man o&rsquo; yourn.
I s&rsquo;pose you haven&rsquo;t heard from him yet, Mis&rsquo;
Wiggin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother tried to answer, but her lips quivered
and she had to turn away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, so long, folks!&rsquo; the old man called, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
be over agin &rsquo;fore spring, the snow permittin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We children climbed on the gate and stood as
high as we could to watch our good friend ride
away. What we did not know until later, was that
as soon as he was out of our sight, he turned and
rode that twenty miles to the village post office. A
week later Mother was indeed surprised to see Mr.
Eastland returning, and this time he brought a letter.
It was with eager joy that Mother leaped forward
to take it, but it was with a cry of grief that she
covered her face with her hands and hurried into
the house. The letter had fallen, and I picked it up
and glanced at it. Father never got there, it said,
but when he knew he was going to die he asked
someone to write. He had worked days and walked
nights and died of exposure and exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spring came and with the first balmy days our
mother was taken from us. We children were eleven
years old then, and we knew not what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We must go to Mr. Eastland,&rsquo; Dean said. &lsquo;He
would want us to.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We went, and that good man took us in, and
made a home for us until&mdash;&rdquo; she paused and looked
around, but as her listeners did not speak, she added:
&ldquo;Perhaps this is all too sad, perhaps you will not
care to hear the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do tell us, dear Nell,&rdquo; Gloria said, and so
the frail girl continued her story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">A PLEASANT PLAN</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The summer following our mother&rsquo;s death was
hot and dry,&rdquo; the frail girl continued, &ldquo;and the grass
around Mr. Eastland&rsquo;s shack, though tall from early
rains, was parched in August.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One morning before he rode in town, our
foster-father jokingly told my brother Dean that he
would leave the place in his care. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ye let
anything happen to it, sonny,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dean, who is always serious, looked up at the
old man on the mule as he replied: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care
of it, Daddy Eastland, even with my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought nothing of this. My brother was a
dreamer, living, it sometimes seemed, in a world of
his own creating. I now realize that my foster-father
and I did not quite understand him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was an intensely hot day. How the grass got
on fire I do not know, but about noon I heard a cry
from Dean, who had been lying for hours on the
ground in the shade of the shack reading a book of
poetry that a traveling missionary had brought to
him. He had visited us six months before and had
promised the next time he came that he would bring
a book for my brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard Dean&rsquo;s cry of alarm and saw him
leap to his feet and run toward a swiftly approaching
column of smoke, I also ran, but not being as
fleet of foot, I was soon far behind him. He had
caught up a burlap bag as he passed a shed; then,
on he raced toward the fire. I, too, paused to get
a bag, but when I started on I saw my brother suddenly
plunge forward and disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had caught his foot in a briar and had fallen
into a thicket which, a moment later, with a crackle
and roar leaped into flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His cap had slipped over his face, thank heaven,
and so his truly beautiful eyes and features were
spared, but his body was badly burned when the fire
had swept over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind had veered very suddenly and turned
the flame back upon the charred land and so, there
being nothing left to burn, it was extinguished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was at that moment that Daddy Eastland returned.
He lifted my unconscious brother out of
the black, burnt thicket and carried him to the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Boy! Boy!&rsquo; he said, and I never will forget the
sob there was in his voice. &lsquo;Why did you say ye&rsquo;d
take care of the old place with your life? &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t
worth one hair on yer head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dean was not dead. Slowly, so slowly he
came back to life, but his left arm was burned to the
bone and his side beneath it. Then, because of the
pain, his muscles tightened and he could not move
his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were so far from town that perhaps he did
not have just the right care. Once a month a quack
physician made the rounds of those remote farms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, he did the best that he could, and a
year later Dean was able to walk about. How like
our mother he was, so brave and cheerful!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am glad that it is my left arm that will not
move, Sister,&rsquo; he often said. &lsquo;I have a use for my
right arm.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our foster-father, noting how it pleased the lad,
invented tasks around the farm that a one-armed
boy could do to help, but when he was fourteen years
of age I discovered what he had meant when he
said that he had a use for his right arm. He had
a little den of his own in the loft of the old barn
with a big opening that overlooked meadow lands,
a winding silver ribbon of a river and distant hills,
and there he spent hours every day writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last he confessed that he was trying to make
verse like that in his one greatly treasured book. It
was his joy, and he had so little that I encouraged
him, though I could not understand his poetry. I am
more like our father, who was a faithful plodding
farmer, and Dean is like our mother, who could tell
such wonderful stories out of her own head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, when I was eighteen years old, I told
Daddy Eastland that I wanted to go to the city to
earn my own way and send some money back for
Dean. How the lad grieved when I left, for he said
that he was the one who should go out in the world
and work for both of us, but I told him to keep on
with his writing and that maybe, some day, he would
be able to earn money with his poetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I came to town and began as an errand girl
in a big department store.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I earn eighteen dollars a week and I send
half of it back to the little rocky farm in New England.
Too, I send magazines and books, but now
a new problem has presented itself. Mr. Eastland
has died, and Dean is alone, and so I have sent for
him to come and live with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How glad I shall be to see him, but I dread having
him know where I live. He will guess at once
that I chose a basement room that I might have
money to send to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Miss Selenski who interrupted: &ldquo;Miss
Wiggin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;while you have been talking,
I have chosen you to be my successor. Tomorrow I
am to be married, and I promised the ladies who
built the model tenements that I would find someone
fitted to take my place before I left. The pay is
better than you are getting. It is twenty-five dollars
a week, with a sunny little apartment to live in. I
want all of you girls to come to my wedding and
then, when I am gone, Miss Wiggin, you can move
right in, and you will be there to welcome that wonderful
brother of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>It would be hard to imagine a happier girl than
Nell when she learned that a brighter future awaited
her than she had dared to dream. She tried to thank
her benefactor, but her sensitive lips quivered and
the girls knew that she was so overcome with emotion
that she might cry, and so Miss Selenski began
at once to tell them about her wedding plans, and
then, soon after she had finished, the girls who had
been invited for tea arrived. Miss Selenski knew
many of them, and so the conversation became general
and little Nell Wiggin was permitted to quietly
become accustomed to her wonderful good fortune
before she was again asked to join in the conversation.
Bobs walked with her to the elevated, and
merry plans she laid for the pleasant times the Vandergrifts
were to have with their new neighbors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">THE DETECTIVE DETECTED</span></h2>
<p>One Monday, at high noon, the pretty Miss
Selenski was married in the Hungarian church and
her four new friends were among the many foreign
women who came to wish their kindly neighbor much
happiness in her new life.</p>
<p>Gloria had been pleased with the earnest face of
the man who had won the love of little Miss Selenski,
and when the smiling pair rode away on an automobile
delivery truck, which was their very own, the
Vandergrift girls, with Nell Wiggin, stood on a
crowded street corner and waved and nodded, promising
that very soon they would visit the little home,
with a yard around it, that was out near the woodsy
Bronx Park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Bobs at the last moment had tied an old shoe to
the back of the truck with a white ribbon, and there
it hung dangling and bobbing in a manner most
festive, while through a small hole in the sole of it
a stream of rice trickled, but in the thronging, surging
masses of East Side humanity this little drama
was scarcely noticed.</p>
<p>When Mr. and Mrs. Cheniska had disappeared up
Third Avenue, Gloria turned to smile at little Nell
Wiggin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let us make haste to get your new apartment
in order that you may wire your brother to
come at once; that is, if a wire will reach him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed it will, and he is eagerly awaiting
it,&rdquo; Nell happily replied. &ldquo;Since our foster-father&rsquo;s
death my brother has been living in town with the
missionary of whom I told you, the one who used to
visit the remote farms and who brought my brother,
years ago, his first book of poetry. They have been
close friends ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when the girls reached the little apartment,
they found that there was nothing to be done. It
was in perfect order, and the thoughtful bride had
even left part of her wedding flowers that they might
be there to welcome the new agent of the model
tenements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be nothing to do here,&rdquo; beamingly
Miss Wiggin said. &ldquo;Perhaps I would better
go at once to my room and pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go with you and help,&rdquo; Bobs told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then both of you come to the Pensinger mansion
for lunch,&rdquo; Lena May suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do about notifying Mr. Queerwitz?&rdquo;
Bobs inquired an hour later as the two girls
started down Fourth Avenue toward the basement
home of Nell Wiggin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing as yet. That is, I merely telephoned
that I would not be there today. I suppose I will
have to give two weeks&rsquo; notice. Let us go there at
once and I will do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the two girls entered the Queerwitz Antique
Shop, Miss Peerwinkle seemed to be much excited
because of their arrival and, hastening to the rear
door, which was labeled &ldquo;No Admittance,&rdquo; she gave
three sharp raps and then hurried back and took up
her post near the front door, as though to prevent
escape in that direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>Bobs looked all around, wondering if there was
a customer in the store who was being watched, but
she and Nell seemed to be the only other occupants
of the place. To add to the mysteriousness, Miss
Harriet Dingley, upon receiving a nod from the head
lady, walked to the entrance of the cloakroom, deliberately
turned the key and put it in her pocket.</p>
<p>Bobs, always on the alert, noted all this and marveled
at it. Surely Nell Wiggin had done nothing
to arouse the suspicion of Mr. Queerwitz! Then,
suddenly, a very possible solution of the mystery
flashed into Roberta&rsquo;s consciousness.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly Mr. Queerwitz suspected that the
late Miss Dolittle had something to do with the disappearance,
reappearance and subsequent sale of the
rare old book. She well knew how enraged the grasping
shopkeeper would be if he learned that he had
received only half as much for the second volume as
had been paid by Mr. Van Loon for the first, and
if that gentleman had described the girl who had sold
the book to him! Bobs actually smiled as she
thought, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m trapped all right. A fine detective
I would make when I never even thought to
wear a disguise. Well, the game&rsquo;s up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>She knew that she ought to feel troubled when
she saw Mr. Queerwitz emerge from his secret sanctum
and approach her, looking about as friendly as
a thunder cloud, but, instead, that irrepressible girl
felt amused as though she were embarking upon another
interesting adventure, and she actually smiled
to greet him. Bobs was depending upon her natural
quick-wittedness to save her from whatever avalanche
of wrath was about to descend upon her.</p>
<p>She had glanced beyond the man, then suddenly
she stared as though amazed at what she saw back
of him. The shopkeeper, noting this, turned and
observed that in his haste he had neglected to latch
the door labeled &ldquo;No Admittance,&rdquo; and that a
draught of air had opened it.</p>
<p>Beyond plainly were seen several workmen engaged
in making antique furniture. Mr. Queerwitz
looked sharply at the girl, trying to learn, if possible,
how much of his secret had been revealed to her.</p>
<p>His anger increased when he saw that her eyes
were laughing. &ldquo;What puzzles me,&rdquo; she was saying,
innocently, &ldquo;is how you can make things look worm-eaten
as well as time-worn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Whatever accusations might have been on the lips
of Mr. Queerwitz when he approached Roberta, they
were never uttered. Instead he turned and walked
rapidly back to his workshop and closed the door,
none too quietly, but in a manner that seemed to
convince Miss Peerwinkle that she and Miss Dingley
need no longer guard the entrances.</p>
<p>How Bobs wanted to laugh, but instead she
walked over to Nell Wiggin, who had been collecting
the few things that she had at the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you given notice?&rdquo; Roberta inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote a note and asked Miss Peerwinkle to give
it to Mr. Queerwitz. Come, let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later Nell Wiggin was packing her
few garments in a suitcase, while Roberta tied up
the precious books. Two hours later the new agent
of the model tenements was established in the sunny
apartment and her row of red-bound books stood on
one shelf of the built-in bookcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I will wire my brother Dean that he may
come as soon as he wishes; and oh, how I do hope
that will be soon,&rdquo; Nell said as she happily surveyed
the pleasantest place that she had ever called home.</p>
<p>The message was sent when they were on their
way to the Pensinger mansion for lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not remain long,&rdquo; the new agent told
Gloria, &ldquo;for I promised Mrs. Doran-Ashley that I
would be on duty at one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Every little while during that noon meal Bobs
would look up with laughing eyes. At last she told
the cause of her mirth. &ldquo;I am wondering what Mr.
James Jewett thinks of his assistant detective,&rdquo; she
remarked. &ldquo;I am so glad that I gave the name Miss
Dolittle. Now I can retire from the profession without
being traced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good, here comes the postman,&rdquo; Lena May
declared as she rose and went to the side door to
meet the mail-carrier. Gloria looked up eagerly.
She was always hoping that Gwendolyn would write.
The letters that she had sent to the Newport home
of the schoolmate whom Gwendolyn had said that
she was going to visit, had been returned, marked
&ldquo;Whereabouts not known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were two letters and both were for Bobs.
One was a bulging missive from her Long Island
friend, Dick De Laney, but it was at the other that
the girl stared as though in uncomprehending amazement.
The cause of her very evident astonishment
was the printed return address in the upper left-hand
corner. It was &ldquo;Fourth Avenue Branch, Burns
Detective Agency.&rdquo; Then she glanced, still puzzled,
at her own name, which was written, not typed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Roberta Vandergrift,&rdquo; she read aloud.
Then suddenly she laughed, and looking up at the
other girls who, all interest, were awaiting an explanation
of her queer conduct, she exclaimed: &ldquo;The
amateur detective has been detected, but how under
the shining heavens did Mr. James Jewett know that
my name wasn&rsquo;t Miss Dolittle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gloria smiled. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t much faith, it would
seem, in his ability as a detective. What has he
written, Bobs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were few words in the message:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Vandergrift, please report at this office at
once, as we have need of your services. Signed.
J. G. Jewett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be flabbergasted!&rdquo; Roberta ejaculated.
&ldquo;But I must confess I am curious, and so I will
immediately, if not sooner, hie me down that way.
Wait a jiff, Miss Wiggin. I&rsquo;ll walk along with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Roberta and Nell were gone, Gloria found
the bulging letter from Bobs&rsquo; oldest friend, Dick De
Laney, lying on the table unopened. The girl who
was so loved by that faithful lad had quite forgotten
it in her new interests. Gloria sighed. &ldquo;Poor Dick,&rdquo;
she said to Lena May as she placed the letter on a
mantel, &ldquo;I wish he did not care so much for Roberta,
for I fear that she does not really care for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>True it was that at that particular moment Bobs
was far more interested in learning what Mr. Jewett
had to tell her than in any message that a letter from
Dick might contain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">A NEW &ldquo;CASE&rdquo; FOR BOBS</span></h2>
<p>The outer office of the Fourth Avenue Branch of
the Burns Detective Agency was vacant when the
girl entered, but almost instantly the door of
the inner office opened and Mr. Jewett himself stood
there. His pleasant face brightened when he saw
his visitor. Advancing with his right hand extended,
he exclaimed: &ldquo;Miss Vandergrift, I am
almost surprised to see you. I really feared that you
had deserted your new profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;Mr. Jewett&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;my name. I told
you that it was Miss Dolittle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man drew forward a chair for her,
then seated himself at his desk, and again Roberta
realized that, although his face was serious, his gray-blue
eyes were smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The letter I sent to you was addressed to Miss
Roberta Vandergrift,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and, since you have
replied in person, am I not justified in believing that
to be your real name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs flushed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to acknowledge that it is,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but the other day when you asked me my
name, I didn&rsquo;t quite like to give that of our family
and so, at random, I chose one.&rdquo; Then the girl
smiled frankly at him. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have chosen a
worse one, it seems. Miss Dolittle did not impress
my late employer as being a good name for a clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong there,&rdquo; the young man told her,
and at last there was no mistaking the fact that he
was amused. &ldquo;Mr. Queerwitz decided that you did
too much and not too little. I don&rsquo;t know when I
have been so pleased as I was over the fact, which
so disturbs him, that you were able to drive the
better bargain. Mr. Queerwitz has excelled in that
line, and to have a mere slip of a girl obtain one
thousand dollars for a book, the mate of which
brought him but five hundred dollars, is humiliating
to say the least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Then, leaning forward, the young man said, with
evident interest: &ldquo;Miss Vandergrift, will you tell
me what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta&rsquo;s expression was sphynx-like. &ldquo;I understand,
Mr. Jewett,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that one need not
give incriminating evidence against oneself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her eyes twinkled. &ldquo;And what is more,&rdquo;
she told him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that it is necessary.
This office seems to have ferreted out the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; the young man confessed, &ldquo;and
now I will tell you just what happened. It seems
that while you were out for lunch Mr. Queerwitz,
or one of his assistants, discovered that the rare
book was missing. He phoned me at once and reported
that his head clerk believed that you had
taken the book. She had found you so absorbed in
it earlier in the day that you had not even been
conscious of her presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assured Mr. Queerwitz that I believed he was
on the wrong trail, but he insisted that a detective be
sent to watch your actions. This was done, and that
night the report delivered to this office was that you
had visited an old second-hand book shop on Third
Avenue; that from there you had mailed one book,
and had then taken another to Mr. Van Loon, sold
it, and had delivered the money to the old bookseller.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our natural conclusion was that the stolen book
was the one that you had sold, but when Mr. Van
Loon was reached by telephone, he stated that the
first of the volumes was the one that he had purchased
for one thousand dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We said nothing of all this to Mr. Queerwitz, as
we wished to see if the book that you had mailed was
the one that had been taken from the antique shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not until the following noon that the book
was delivered, and almost immediately afterward
Mr. Van Loon appeared and purchased it for five
hundred dollars during the absence of Mr. Queerwitz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were then forced to conclude that the old
bookseller on Third Avenue had been the thief, and
we sent at once to his shop to have him arrested,
only to discover that with his wife, Marlitta, he had
sailed for Europe at daybreak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;However, our detective reported that Miss Dolittle
was at the shop, having all of the old books
heaped upon a cart. Being truly puzzled by the case,
I decided to follow it up myself, which I did, reaching
the place in my closed car just as you were being
driven away on the book-laden truck. I followed,
unobserved, and when you descended in front of the
Pensinger mansion, with which place I am familiar,
I decided that you lived there. To verify this I
visited the grocer who has charge of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a few purchases and then said casually
to the grocer: &lsquo;I see the old Pensinger mansion is
occupied. People been there long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tenowitz, as I hoped, was garrulous and
told me all he knew about the three Vandergrift girls
who had taken possession of the place. He said
the one answering to your description was called
Roberta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the grocer really knew little about you,
but it was not hard for a detective to learn much
more about a family that, for generations, has been
so well known in New York. But there is one thing
I do not understand, and that is your evident interest
in that old second-hand dealer in books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you gladly,&rdquo; Roberta said, and she
recounted the story from the moment when she had
caught a first glimpse of the spray of lilacs, unconsciously
telling him more than her words did of how
touched her heart was by the poverty and sorrow
that she was seeing for the first time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>When she paused, he looked thoughtfully out of
the window. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I ought to permit
you to continue in this line of work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A
girl brought up as you have been can know nothing,
really, of the dangers that lurk everywhere in this
great city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Jewett!&rdquo; Bobs was eager, &ldquo;please let me
try just once more; then, if I fail again I will endeavor
to find a profession for which I am better
fitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will,&rdquo; was the smiling reply, &ldquo;for
this case cannot lead you into places that might be
unwise for you to visit. In fact, I am sure that it is
a case that will greatly interest a young girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jewett paused to take a note book from his
pocket. While he was scanning the pages Roberta
leaned forward, waiting, almost breathlessly eager.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Mr. Jewett, glancing up from his note book,
smiled to see Bobs&rsquo; eager, interested expression.
Then he told her about the case. &ldquo;A certain Mrs.
Waring-Winston, who is prominent in society, has
a daughter who, although brought up in a convent,
is determined to go upon the stage. Her mother has
tried every form of persuasion to prevent this unfortunate
step, and at last she decided that a year of
travel in Europe might have the desired effect, and
so she engaged passage upon a steamer which is to
sail next week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Waring-Winston believed that if she could
interest the girl in other things just now, on their
return to this country she might entirely abandon
her determination to become a chorus girl. The
mother assured me that Winnie, her daughter, is not
talented enough to advance beyond that point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the girl, it would seem, has more determination
and self-will than she has talent, for when her
mother informed her of the plans she had made,
although outwardly seeming to acquiesce, she was
inwardly rebellious as her subsequent actions proved,
for that night she disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three days have passed and she has not returned.
Mrs. Waring-Winston did not report the
matter at once, believing that Winnie must have gone
to stay with girl friends in the suburbs; but yesterday,
having inquired at all possible places where her
daughter might visit without having found a trace
of her whereabouts, Mrs. Waring-Winston, in desperation,
appealed to us, imploring us forever to keep
the matter secret. We, of course, agreed to do this,
and it was then that I determined to send for you,
believing that a young girl could find Winnie sooner
than one of our men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, Mr. Jewett, that the daughter of
Mrs. Waring-Winston has joined a theatrical troupe
in this city?&rdquo; Bobs inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that it is more possible that she has joined
a troupe that either has or soon will leave town to
tour the country, but of course we must first visit
the playhouses in the city. I have two other women
working on the case, as I wish if possible to cover
all of the theaters today. I have assigned to you a
group of Broadway playhouses that you can easily
visit during the matinee performances. Here is a
photograph of the missing girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta looked at the pictured face. &ldquo;How lovely
she is!&rdquo; was her comment. &ldquo;I do not wonder that
her mother wants to protect her. How I do hope
that I will be able to find Winnie and persuade her
to wait, at least, until she is eighteen years of age
before choosing a profession.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>The girl rose. &ldquo;It is one-thirty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps
I had better be starting. Do I have to have
a pass or something of that sort in order to be
admitted to the theaters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jewett also rose and pinned a badge under
the lapel of the girl&rsquo;s jacket. &ldquo;Show that,&rdquo; he told
her, &ldquo;and it will be all the pass that you will need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as he held open the door, he smilingly added,
&ldquo;Good luck to you, Miss Dolittle Vandergrift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs flashed a merry smile back at the young man.
&ldquo;I sincerely hope that I will do more than I did last
time,&rdquo; she said, but, when she was seated in the taxi
which was to take her to her destination on Broadway,
her thoughts were not of the little would-be
actress, but of Gwendolyn. Day after day Roberta
had noted that, try as she might to be cheerful, her
oldest sister, the one who had been Mother to them
all, grew sadder and more troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glow will not be really happy,&rdquo; Bobs was thinking,
&ldquo;until Gwen comes back to us. I cannot see
where she can be, for she had only one month&rsquo;s
allowance with her and she could not live long on
that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Bobs&rsquo; reverie was suddenly interrupted by the
stopping of the taxi, and, looking up, the girl found
that they were in front of one of the festively
adorned theaters. With a rapidly beating heart, she
descended to the walk, made her way through the
throng, showed her badge and was admitted. At
her request an usher led her behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Bobs felt as though she were on the brink of some
momentous discovery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">BOBS TRIES ACTING</span></h2>
<p>When they were behind the scenes, a short,
flashily attired man advanced to meet Roberta and
the usher departed. For one panicky moment Bobs
wondered whether she should tell that she was a
detective. Would the director wish her to interfere
with his plans, as she undoubtedly would be doing
were she to take from him one of his chorus girls?</p>
<p>The alert little man, however, did not need to be
told, for he had caught a glimpse of Roberta&rsquo;s badge
when a projecting bit of scenery had for a moment
pulled at her coat.</p>
<p>Rubbing his hands, and smiling ingratiatingly, he
said in a voice of oily smoothness: &ldquo;Is it one of
our girls, ma&rsquo;am, that you&rsquo;re wishing to see?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Bob realized that he had guessed her mission and
so she thought best to be perfectly frank with him
and tell the whole story. The little man seemed
greatly relieved, and shook his head many times as
he talked. &ldquo;No such girl here,&rdquo; he assured her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d turn her over to her Ma if there was. Come and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small man spun around with the suddenness
of a top, and Bobs could not help thinking that his
build suggested the shape of that toy. Then he
darted away, dodging the painted trees with great
dexterity, leading the way down dark aisles among
the scenes that were not to be used that day.</p>
<p>At last they reached the dressing rooms. &ldquo;Look
in all of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t knock. Just walk in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with a flourish of his plump diamond-bedecked
hands, which seemed to bestow upon her
the freedom of the place, the small man gave another
of his top-like spins and disappeared among the
scenery.</p>
<p>Roberta found herself standing near a door on
which was a large gilt star.</p>
<p>No need to go in there, she decided, for of course
the girl whom she sought would not be the company&rsquo;s
star, but since she had the open sesame of all
the rooms, why not enter? She had always been
wild to go behind the scenes when she and her sisters
had been seated in a box in this very theater.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Little had she dreamed in those days that now
seemed so far in the past, that day would come
when she would be behind the scenes in the role of
an amateur detective.</p>
<p>As Roberta stood gazing at the closed door, she
saw it open and a maid, dressed trimly in black and
white, hurried out, leaving the door ajar.</p>
<p>Glancing in, Bobs saw a truly beautiful young
woman lounging in a comfortable chair in front of
a long mirror. The maid had evidently been arranging
her hair. Several elaborate gowns were hanging
about the room. Suddenly Roberta flushed, for
she realized that a pair of darkly lashed eyes were
observing her in the mirror. Then the beautiful
face smiled and a slim white hand beckoned.</p>
<p>Entering the small dressing room, Roberta also
smiled into the mirror. &ldquo;Forgive me for gazing so
rudely,&rdquo; she apologized, &ldquo;but all my life I have
wished that I might meet a real star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman turned and with a graceful yet
indolent gesture bade Roberta be seated on a low
chair that was facing her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; was all that she said, and the visitor
thought that even that harsh word was like music,
so deep and rich was the voice that uttered it.</p>
<p>Bobs was puzzled. She looked up inquiringly:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t what?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The white hand rested on Roberta&rsquo;s knee as the
voice continued kindly: &ldquo;If you were my sister,
I would say don&rsquo;t, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> take up the stage as a profession.
It&rsquo;s such a weary, thankless life. Only a
few of us reach the top, little girl, and it&rsquo;s such a
hard grind. Too, if you want to live right, theatrical
folk think you are queer and you don&rsquo;t win their
friendship. They say you&rsquo;re not their kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you&mdash;&rdquo; Roberta breathed with very evident
admiration, &ldquo;you are a star. You do not need their
friendship.&rdquo; She was thinking of the small florid
man who had suggested a top.</p>
<p>The actress smiled, and then hurriedly added in
a low voice, for the maid was returning: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
time to talk more, now, but dear girl, even as a star
I say <i>don&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Bobs impulsively caught the frail hand and held
it in a close clasp. She wondered why there were
tears in the dark-lashed eyes. As she was closing
the door after her, she heard the maid address the
star as Miss Merryheart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another fictitious name that doesn&rsquo;t fit,&rdquo; Bobs
thought. How she longed to go back to the little
dressing room and ask Miss Merryheart if there was
something, anything she could do for her; but instead,
with a half sigh, she turned toward an open
door beyond which she could hear laughter and
joking.</p>
<p>Bobs wondered if among those chorus girls she
would find the one she sought.</p>
<p>The door to the larger room was ajar, and Roberta
entered. As she had guessed, there was a bevy of
girls in the room. A dozen mirrors lined the walls
and before each of them stood a young girl applying
paint or powder to her face, or adjusting a wig with
long golden curls. Some of them were dressed in
spangly tights and others in very short skirts that
stood out stiffly.</p>
<p>This was unmistakably the chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, sweetie,&rdquo; a buxom maiden near the door
sang out when she observed the newcomer. &ldquo;What
line of talk are you goin&rsquo; to give us? The last guy
as was here asked us if our souls was saved. Is that
the dope you&rsquo;ve got up your sleeve?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Roberta smiled so frankly that she seemed to disarm
their fears that they were to be preached to.
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; she began, as she sat on a trunk near the
door, &ldquo;do you all like this life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another girl whirled about and, pausing in the
process of applying a lip stick, she winked wisely at
the one who had first spoken. &ldquo;Say, Pink,&rdquo; she
called, &ldquo;I got&rsquo;er spotted. She&rsquo;s an ink-slinger for
some daily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong you are,&rdquo; Bobs merrily replied. Then
she turned to a slender girl who was standing at the
mirror next to her, who had appeared quite indifferent
to the newcomer&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;How is it with
you?&rdquo; Roberta asked her directly. &ldquo;Do you like
this life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was one of the bolder girls who replied:
&ldquo;Sure thing, we all like the life. It&rsquo;s great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to join the high kicks?&rdquo; This question
was asked by still another girl who, having completed
her toilet, now sauntered up and stood directly
in front of Bobs. For one moment the young detective&rsquo;s
heart beat rapidly, for the newcomer&rsquo;s resemblance
to the picture was striking, but another girl
was saying: &ldquo;Bee, there, has been with this here
show for two years, and she likes the life, don&rsquo;t
you, Bee?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>So, after all, this wasn&rsquo;t the one whom she
sought.</p>
<p>Bobs decided to take them into her confidence.
Smiling around in the winning way that she had,
she began: &ldquo;Girls, you&rsquo;ve had three guesses and
missed, so now I&rsquo;ll put you wise. I&rsquo;m looking for
a Winifred Waring-Winston, whose mamma-dear
wishes to see her at once, if not sooner. Can you
tell me at which theater I can find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others grouped about Roberta, but all shook
their heads. &ldquo;Dunno as I&rsquo;d squeal on her if I did
know,&rdquo; said the one called Pink. &ldquo;But as it happens,
I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor did the others, it would seem, and when
Roberta was convinced that Winnie was not to be
found there, she left, but, as the curtain had raised
on the first scene, she paused near the front door to
hear Miss Merryheart sing. Truly she was an
actress, Bobs thought, for no one in that vast audience
who saw the star could have guessed that only
a brief time before there had been tears in those
dark-lashed eyes that now seemed to be brimming
with mirth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>At the next theater she entered, Bobs had an
unexpected and rather startling experience. Just as
she appeared in the dimly lighted space back of the
scenes, she was pounced upon by a man who was
undoubtedly the stage manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Finefeather,&rdquo; he said, in a hoarse whisper,
&ldquo;What? You late again? Two minutes only to get
into your riggin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Then giving Bobs a shove toward
an open door, he called hoarsely: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s that laggard,
Stella. Help her and be quick. We don&rsquo;t want
any hitches in this scene. No time for explainin&rsquo;.
That, an&rsquo; settlin&rsquo; accounts will come later,&rdquo; he added
when Bobs tried to turn back to explain that she
was <i>not</i> Miss Finefeather.</p>
<p>The man was gone and the leading chorus girl
pounced upon her and, with the aid of two others,
she was being disrobed. To her amusement as well
as amazement, she soon found herself arrayed in
tights with a short spangled overskirt. Resignedly
she decided to see it through. Just at that moment
a buzzer sounded, which seemed to be a signal for
the entrance of the chorus. &ldquo;Here you, Miss Finefeather,&rdquo;
someone was saying, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you remember
overnight where your place is? Just back of me,
and do everything I do and you&rsquo;ll get through all
right.&rdquo; The voice was evidently intended to be kind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Bobs followed the one ahead, trying to suppress
an almost uncontrollable desire to laugh. Who in
the world did they suppose her to be? she wondered.
The girls had divided into two long lines and they
entered the stage from opposite sides. Bobs was
thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard folk say it&rsquo;s hard to get on
the stage. Strikes me it&rsquo;s just the other way. I jolly
wish, though, I had some idea what I&rsquo;m supposed
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta&rsquo;s reverie was interrupted by her kindly
neighbor, who whispered: &ldquo;Gimme your paw.
Here&rsquo;s where we swing, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t forget to keep
your feet going all the time. There&rsquo;s no standing
still in this act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being in it, Bobs decided to try to do her best,
and, having been a champion in school athletics, she
was limber and mentally alert and went through the
skipping and whirling and various gyrations almost
as well as though she had been trained. However,
when the act was finished and the chorus girls, with
a burst of singing laughter, had run from the stage,
the man whom she had first seen came up to her,
profuse with apologies. He had just received a
message telling him that Miss Finefeather was very
ill and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep on with the work.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with very sincere
admiration. &ldquo;How you went through that act and
never missed so&rsquo;s one could notice it proves you&rsquo;re
the girl for the place. Say you&rsquo;d like it and the
position&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Bobs paused, but in that moment she seemed to
hear Miss Merryheart&rsquo;s one word: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta thanked the man, but said that her business
engagements for that afternoon were so urgent
that she could not even remain for another act.</p>
<p>Having learned that Miss Finefeather had been
with them but a few days, Bobs, believing that she
might be the girl whom she sought, asked for her
address, and departed.</p>
<p>Her heart was filled with hope, &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve
hit the right trail,&rdquo; she thought, as she hurried out
of the theater.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">WHO WAS MISS FINEFEATHER</span></h2>
<p>Roberta stepped into a drug store to inquire the
way to the address that she had upon a slip of brown
paper. The clerk happened to know the locality
without referring to the directory, and Bobs was
thanking him when one of the customers exclaimed
in a voice that plainly expressed the speaker&rsquo;s great
joy: &ldquo;Bobsy Vandergrift, of all people! Where in
the world are you girls living? Dick wrote me that
you had left Long Island, but he failed to tell me
where you had located?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Kathryn De Laney who, as she talked, drew
Bobs into a quiet booth. The girls seated themselves
and clasped hands across the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kathy,&rdquo; Bobs said, her eyes glowing with
the real pleasure that she felt, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning
to look you up, for Gloria&rsquo;s sake, if for no other
reason. I heard Glow say only the other day that
she wanted to see you. I believe you&rsquo;d do her worlds
of good. You&rsquo;re so breezy and cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kathryn looked troubled. &ldquo;Why, is anything
especially wrong with Glow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s brooding because Gwen doesn&rsquo;t write,&rdquo;
Bobs said. Then she told briefly all that had happened:
how Gwen had refused to come with the
others to try to earn her living, and how instead she
had departed without saying good-bye to them to
visit her school friend, Eloise Rochester, and how
letters, sent there by Gloria, had been returned
marked &ldquo;Whereabouts unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I honestly believe that Gloria thinks of nothing
else. I&rsquo;ve watched her when she was pretending to
read, and she doesn&rsquo;t turn a page by the hour. I had
just about made up my mind to put an advertisement
of some kind in the paper. Not that I&rsquo;m crazy about
Gwen myself. There&rsquo;s no excuse for one sister being
so superlatively selfish and disagreeable as she is,
but Gloria believes, she honestly does, that if we are
patient and loving, Gwen will change in time, because
after all she is our mother&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gloria is right,&rdquo; was the quiet answer. &ldquo;I am
sure of that. You all helped to spoil Gwen when she
was a child because she was frail. Then later you
let her have her own way because you dreaded her
temper spells, but I honestly believe that a few hard
knocks will do much toward readjusting Gwendolyn&rsquo;s
outlook upon life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Kathryn!&rdquo; Bobs exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know that Gwen couldn&rsquo;t stand hard knocks? If it
were a case of sink or swim, Gwen would just give
up and sink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; the girl who had been next
door neighbor to the Vandergrifts all her life replied.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an instinct with all of us to at least try
to keep our heads above water.&rdquo; Then she added:
&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t I hear you asking the clerk about an
address? That was what first attracted my attention
to you, because it is the same locality as my
destination. I&rsquo;m visiting nurse now on the lower
West Side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after glancing at the slip of paper Bobs
held up, Kathryn continued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call a taxi, and
while we are riding down there you can tell me all
about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>When they were settled for the long ride, Bobs
blurted out: &ldquo;Say, Kathy, before I begin, please
tell me why you&rsquo;ve taken up nursing? A girl with
a thousand dollars a month income hardly needs the
salary derived from such service, and, of course, I
know that you take none. Phyl said she thought
you ought to be examined by a lunacy board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kathryn laughed good-naturedly as she replied:
&ldquo;Oh, Phyl means all right. She does think I&rsquo;m
crazy, but honestly, Bobsy, anyone who lives the idle,
selfish butterfly life that Phyllis does is worse than
not sane, I think: but she will wake up as Gwen will,
some day, and see the worthlessness of it all. Now
tell me about yourself. Why are you bound for the
lower West Side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs told her story. How Kathryn laughed. &ldquo;A
Vandergrift a detective!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What
would that stately old grandfather of yours have to
say if he knew it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Just about the same
thing that he would say about aircraft or radio.
Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>The recounting of their recent experiences had
occupied so much time that, as its conclusion was
reached, so too was Bobs&rsquo; destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get out with you, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Kathryn
said, &ldquo;for, since Miss Finefeather is ill, I may at
least be able to give her some advice that will help
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta glanced gratefully at her friend. &ldquo;I had
hoped that you would want to come with me,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but I did not like to ask, knowing that your
own mission might be imperative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not.&rdquo; Then, having dismissed the taxi
driver. Kathryn said: &ldquo;I know this building. It is
where a large number of poor struggling artists
have rooms. On each floor there is one community
kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A janitor appeared from the basement at their
ring. She said that Miss Finefeather lived on the
very top floor and that the young ladies might go
right up, and she did hope that they would be on
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On time for what?&rdquo; Kathryn paused to inquire.
The woman gave an indifferent shrug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she informed them, &ldquo;ever so often one of
the artists gets discouraged, and then she happens
to remember that the river isn&rsquo;t so very far away.
Also they just go to sleep sometimes.&rdquo; Another
shrug, and, with the added remark that she didn&rsquo;t
blame them much, the woman returned to her dreary
home.</p>
<p>Bobs shuddered. What if they were too late?
Poor Miss Finefeather, if she were really Winnie
Waring-Winston, as Roberta so hoped, would not
need be discouraged when she had a fine home and
a mother whose only interest in life was to find her.</p>
<p>They were half-way up the long, steep flight of
stairs leading to the top floor when Bobs paused and
looked back at her friend, as she said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost
afraid that this girl cannot be the one I am seeking.
Winnie could not be discouraged in only three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that at once,&rdquo; Kathryn replied, &ldquo;but
she is someone in trouble, and so I must go to her
and see if I can help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>In silence they continued to climb to the top floor,
which was divided into four small rooms. Three of
the doors were locked, but the fourth opened at
their touch, revealing a room so dark that, at first,
they could only see the form of the bed, and were
relieved to note that someone was lying upon it.
But at their entrance there was no movement from
the silent figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;after all&mdash;we came too late,&rdquo; Bobs said
softly, and how her heart ached for the poor girl
lying there, and she wondered who it might be.</p>

<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">THE LOST IS FOUND</span></h2>
<p>Kathryn crossed to the one window and drew
up the shade. It was late afternoon and almost dusk
on that north side of the house. The dim light
revealed on the pillow a face so still and white that
Bobs was sure only death could make it so. For one
long moment she gazed before she recognized the
girl lying on the bed, and no wonder, for great was
the change in her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwen! It&rsquo;s our own Sister Gwen!&rdquo; she cried
as one who can scarcely believe the evidence of her
senses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Down by the bedside Roberta knelt and took one
of the lifeless white hands in her own. &ldquo;Oh, Gwen,&rdquo;
she implored, &ldquo;why did you do it? You thought we
didn&rsquo;t want you. You believed that in all the world
there was no one who loved you, no home in which
you were welcome. Oh, how selfish I&rsquo;ve been! Gwen,
forgive me, Sister. I should have tried to help you.
I was the one really who was selfish, for I wanted
adventure. I didn&rsquo;t try to think what it would mean
to you; but O, I will, I will, Gwen, if only you will
live. Why don&rsquo;t you open your eyes, Gwen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as there was no response from the apparently
lifeless form on the bed, Bobs looked up at her
friend as she implored: &ldquo;Kathryn, why doesn&rsquo;t Gwen
open her eyes? Are we too late? O, don&rsquo;t say that
we are. It will kill Glow. She thinks that it is her
fault that Gwen left. She feels that she turned one
of Mother&rsquo;s own daughters out of our home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kathryn, who had been hunting about the room
as though in search of something, as indeed she had
been, gave an exclamation of relief and, going to
Bobs, she held out a small vial. &ldquo;Gwen isn&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t poison that she took. Just a
heavy dose of sleeping powder. However, she will
probably continue in this deathlike sleep for hours,
and yet she may soon recover. We have no time to
delay. I will remain here while you go to the corner
drug store and telephone to my hospital for an ambulance.
Just say that it is for Miss De Laney and
they will respond at once. While she is unable to
protest, we will take her to your home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Bobs had arisen, but lovingly she stooped and
kissed the white face that was so unlike the proud,
beautiful one she had last seen on that never-to-be-forgotten
day when they had planned leaving their
Long Island home.</p>
<p>Tears fell unheeded as Roberta whispered to ears
that could not hear: &ldquo;And when you waken, Sister
dear, you will be in a home that wants you, and our
Gloria, who has tried to be Mother to us all these
years will be at your side smiling down, and a new
life will begin for you and for us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, almost blinded by her tears, Roberta descended
the long, dark flight of stairs and telephoned
not only to the hospital, but also to Gloria, telling
her the wonderful news and bidding her prepare
Bobs&rsquo; own room for the sister who was coming
home.</p>
<p>Two hours later Gwendolyn, who had not awakened,
was lying in the comfortable bed in Bobs&rsquo;
room. Her three sisters and their friend, Kathryn
De Laney, stood watching her in the shaded lamp-light.
The expression on the face of Gloria told
more than words could have done what it meant to
her to have this one of her dear mother&rsquo;s daughters
back in the home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And a real home it is going to be to her from
now on if patient love can make it so,&rdquo; Gloria said.
Then to the nurse she turned, asking, &ldquo;Will it be
long before she wakens, Kathryn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought not to be long,&rdquo; was the reply, which
had hardly been given when Roberta whispered
eagerly, &ldquo;Glow, I think Gwen moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes that looked so wearily out at them were
about to close as though nothing mattered, when
suddenly they were again opened with a brightening
expression, and yet they did not look quite natural.</p>
<p>Holding out her arms toward the oldest sister,
the girl on the bed cried eagerly: &ldquo;Mother, I have
come to you after all. I took something. I wanted
to come&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice trailed away and again she
closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Gloria was the one of the girls who looked most
like their mother. &ldquo;Dear, dear Sister,&rdquo; Glow said,
trying not to sob, &ldquo;you are home again. I am sure
that our mother led us to you. Try to get strong.
We will help you, Gwendolyn, for truly we love you.
No one knows, little Gwen, how your big sister has
wanted you. Can&rsquo;t you try to forgive me for having
spoken impatiently, if not for my sake, at least for
the sake of our mother?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Gwendolyn looked at the face bent close above
her as though trying to recall the past. Then, reaching
out a frail hand, she said, &ldquo;I, Glow, am the one
who should be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she closed her eyes, and a moment later
Kathryn said that she was asleep, but that this time
it was a natural sleep from great weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she wakens again, give her broth, for I
fear she is too nearly starved to take heavier food
just now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">A FAILURE THAT WAS SUCCESS</span></h2>
<p>The day following that on which Gwen had been
found, Detective Bobs had gone early in the morning
to report at the Fourth Avenue Branch of the
Burns Agency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jewett,&rdquo; she began at once, &ldquo;as a detective
I certainly am a failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll agree with you
that in one way, you certainly are, but nevertheless
you accomplished your mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs&rsquo; expression of blank surprise seemed to delight
her employer. &ldquo;But, Mr. Jewett, what can
you mean? It was my sister whom I found. I did
not find Miss Winston-Waring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes you did, and you talked with her, or to her,
rather.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be flabbergasted!&rdquo; Then Bobs apologized.
&ldquo;Pardon my lingo, Mr. Jewett. Our gardener&rsquo;s
boy used to say that when he was greatly
astonished, and I certainly never was more so. When,
in the name of mystery, did I talk to that young lady,
and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at the first theater that you visited. Miss
Winifred said that you came into the dressing room
and that after two of the girls, called Pink and Bee,
had talked with you awhile, you turned to her, for
her mirror was nearest you, and asked her directly
if she liked the life of a chorus girl. She did not
know how to reply, for the truth was that her
three days&rsquo; experience on the stage had greatly disillusioned
her. She had found the rough ways of
the girls repellent to her refined, sensitive nature,
and she was afraid of the stage manager, whose
criticisms were sarcastic and even unkind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While she was hesitating, Bee, it seems, had replied
for her, and then it was that you had explained
your mission. She, of course, had not given her real
name, and so no one suspected that she was Miss
Winifred Waring-Winston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Her pride alone kept her from following you
and confessing her identity. She had declared to
her mother that she would live her own life in her
own way, and she could not bear to acknowledge her
defeat. Too, there was one bright spot in her new
profession, which was that the star, Miss Merryheart,
had singled her out and was very kind to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That same afternoon, it seems, after the matinee,&rdquo;
Mr. Jewett continued, &ldquo;Miss Merryheart sent
for her to come to her dressing room. The others
were jealous and said things that were so unkind and
untrue that the sensitive girl was almost in tears
when she reached the room of the star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the door had been closed and they were
alone, Miss Merryheart placed kindly hands on her
shoulders and looked deep into the tear-brimmed
eyes. &lsquo;Dear little girl,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;why didn&rsquo;t you
tell our visitor that you are Winifred Waring-Winston?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the girl was amazed and greatly puzzled,
for she had told Miss Merryheart nothing at
all concerning her past or her identity, and so she
asked her how she had known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The star replied: &lsquo;I have been long on the stage
and I know when a girl has been brought up in an
environment different from the others. Too, I saw
last night that you were greatly disillusioned, and
I realized by the frightened, anxious glances that
you cast about the audience that you feared someone
might be there who would recognize you in spite of
your disguise, and when our visitor today told me
that in this city there was a home made desolate, a
mother heart breaking because a little girl had run
away to go on the stage, why shouldn&rsquo;t I guess that
you are the one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she added: &lsquo;Tell me your telephone number,
dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; Mr. Jewett concluded, &ldquo;is how it
chanced that an hour later Winifred was restored
to the arms of her mother, who at once canceled her
passage for Europe, as a year abroad would not be
needed to disillusion the little would-be actress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wonderful Miss Merryheart!&rdquo; Bobs said
irrelevantly, &ldquo;I love her and I want to know her
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jewett smiled, &ldquo;Miss Vandergrift, as you
say, you are not exactly a successful detective, and
yet, in both of the cases on which you have been
engaged you have accomplished what might be called
indirect success. For, even though you did help him
to escape, you discovered the thief of the rare old
book, and you have been instrumental in restoring
a lost girl to her mother. Now, I have another case
and one quite different for you. Do you wish to
take it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Bobs laughed. &ldquo;Mr. Jewett,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;like Winnie,
I fear that I, too, am disillusioned. I find that a
detective is not allowed to have sympathy. Honestly,
if my life had depended upon it, I couldn&rsquo;t have
turned that old man over to justice; but what is the
new case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta could not believe that she was hearing
aright when he told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jewett,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;will you kindly say
that over again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was finding his new assistant refreshingly
different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely stated that I would like you to help us
find the heir to the Pensinger Mansion, who&mdash;&rdquo; he
paused and snapped his fingers. &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; he
ejaculated, &ldquo;I had quite forgotten for the moment
that is your present home. All the better, for there
may be some important evidence right on the premises.
Come into my office and I will read all the data
that we have filed up to the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very much interested, Roberta followed the young
man, wondering what she was to hear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>When they were seated, Mr. Jewett said: &ldquo;Perhaps
you know something of the story of the Pensinger
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta replied that she did; that a neighbor, Miss
Selenski, had told about the lost daughter, Marilyn,
and about her father&rsquo;s strange will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is little more known by anyone,&rdquo; Mr.
Jewett said. &ldquo;Judge Caldwaller-Cory, whose father
was Mr. Pensinger&rsquo;s legal advisor and close friend,
is very eager to find the heir before it is too late.
Not many years remain before the property, according
to the will, is to be sold, the money to be devoted
to charity. Judge Cory declares that it haunts
him, sometimes, as the old house is supposed to be
haunted. He feels sure that Marilyn is not living,
but she might have children, somewhere, who are in
need. The judge never accepted the theory which
some held, that the beautiful girl leaped into the
East River on the night that her shawl was found
on the bank. He believes that she was secretly married
and that, with her lover-husband, she departed
for his home country, Hungary.&rdquo; Roberta nodded.
&ldquo;O, I do hope so!&rdquo; she exclaimed so eagerly that
Mr. Jewett smiled. But what he said was: &ldquo;And
so now, once again, the case is to be reopened, and,
as the judge himself is very busy, he has turned the
matter over to his son, who has recently become
junior member of his father&rsquo;s firm. Ralph Caldwaller-Cory
is young and filled with fresh enthusiasms,
and it is <i>his</i> wish that we put on the case a
girl of about the age that Marilyn was at the time,
if we have one in our employ. Since you had not
notified me that you had ceased to be one of us, I told
him that I would procure just the type of person
whom I believed best fitted to assist us. Are you
willing to undertake this case, Miss Vandergrift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs smiled when she heard the name. &ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo;
she said, rising, &ldquo;and <i>this time</i> I hope I will not
<i>do little</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">A NEW ARRIVAL</span></h2>
<p>When Roberta reached home that day, she began
to sniff, for the house seemed to be pervaded with
a most delicious aroma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohee, fried chicken, if I guess aright!&rdquo; she
thought. The front room being vacant, she skipped
down the long, wide hall and pounced into the sunny
combination kitchen and dining-room. Lena May
smiled over her shoulder to greet the newcomer. She
was busy at the stove preparing the noon meal.
Gwendolyn, made comfortable on a pillowed reclining
chair, was lying in the sunshine near the
blossoming window-box. She also smiled, though
she was too weak and weary to speak. Bobs kissed
her tenderly and then inquired: &ldquo;Say, Lena May,
why all this festiveness? It isn&rsquo;t anyone&rsquo;s birthday,
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; their youngest replied as she
stopped to open the oven door, revealing a tin of
biscuits that were browning within. Then, rising,
she added: &ldquo;But, nevertheless, we are celebrating.
You see, Nurse Kathryn ordered chicken broth for
Gwen and, having made that, I decided to fry the
remaining pieces because we are going to have company
for lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, pray?&rdquo; Bobs was removing her hat and
coat as she spoke. Just then Gloria came in from
the Settlement House and she inquired as she glanced
about: &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t the company come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; Lena May looked at the old grandfather
clock. &ldquo;It lacks two minutes of being noon.
They will be here promptly at twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe that you are all trying to arouse my
curiosity,&rdquo; Bobs said. &ldquo;Well, the deed is done, so
fire ahead and tell me who is to be the victim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Victim, indeed.&rdquo; Lena May tossed her curly
head with pretended indignation. &ldquo;I have nine minds
not to give you a single piece of this delicious fried
chicken because of that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Bobs helped her out. &ldquo;Slam on, your cooking is
what you really mean, but of course you can&rsquo;t use
slang, not even in a pinch. But, I say, is our honored
guest fine or superfine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gloria and Lena May exchanged amused glances.
It was the former who replied: &ldquo;The guest of honor
is to be a young gentleman, and, as to his identity,
you may have three guesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This had always been their method of telling each
other interesting news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick De Laney isn&rsquo;t in town, is he?&rdquo; Roberta
inquired in so matter-of-fact and little interested a
manner that again Gloria realized that her sister did
not greatly care for the lad who had loved her since
the pinafore days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;ve heard of,&rdquo; Lena May said. &ldquo;Now
you may guess again.&rdquo; But before this could be
done, the heavy knocker on the front door was announcing
the arrival of someone, and Gloria went
to answer its summons.</p>
<p>Bobs skipped over to the stove as she said hurriedly,
&ldquo;Tell me quickly who is coming, so that I may
be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nell Wiggin and her brother Dean,&rdquo; was the
whispered reply. &ldquo;He came in on the eleven-ten
train. Nell went to meet him and I told her to bring
him over here to lunch. I thought it would be
pleasant for both of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a trump,&rdquo; Bobs began, but paused, for
Gloria was opening the door, saying, &ldquo;Sisters, here
are Nell and her brother Dean.&rdquo; Then to the tall,
pale lad with the dreamy eyes she added: &ldquo;This sister
is Gwendolyn, who has been ill, and this is Lena
May, fork in hand, symbolizing the fact that she is
also our housekeeper. Roberta we call Bobs, for
every family has need of a boy and Bobsy has always
done her best to fill the requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad, unused to girls, acknowledged these introductions
rather shyly. Bobs, knowing that he
was conscious of his muscle-bound left arm, which
he could not move, said at once in her merry, nonsensical
manner: &ldquo;If so many sisters won&rsquo;t frighten
you, Dean, I&rsquo;ll retire from the role of brother and
let you fill it.&rdquo; Then she added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
call you Mr Wiggin. It is too formal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad flushed in his effort to reply, but Lena
May saved him from further embarrassment by
saying, &ldquo;Nell, you and your brother may sit on
either side of Gloria. Bobsy, will you serve the
chicken? Gwen had her broth at eleven, so she isn&rsquo;t
hungry just now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Realizing that the lad who had lived only on remote
New England farms would rather listen than
talk, Bobs monopolized the conversation in her usual
breezy manner, and often when she glanced his way
she noted that the soft brown eyes of the lad were
smiling as though he were much amused. But after
lunch she spoke to him directly. &ldquo;Dean,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;your sister tells me that you love books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; the boy replied, &ldquo;but I have seen
very few and have owned only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; Bobs exclaimed. &ldquo;Come with
me and I will show you several hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several hundred books,&rdquo; the lad gasped, quite
forgetting his self-consciousness in his astonishment
at this amazing remark.</p>
<p>Bobs nodded mysteriously as she led the way to
the room overhead, where in the dim light Dean
beheld old books in dusty piles everywhere about.</p>
<p>There was a sudden glow of pleasure in the eyes
of the boy which told Bobs that he was indeed a
booklover. &ldquo;What a treat this will be,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;if I may browse up here when I wish.&rdquo; Then he
added as a new thought presented itself: &ldquo;But, Miss
Roberta, I must not spend my time in idle reading.
I want to find some way to earn money.&rdquo; Eagerly,
anxiously, his eyes turned toward her. &ldquo;Can you
suggest anything that I might be able to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>For one panicky moment Bobs&rsquo; thoughts groped
wildly for some profession that a one-armed lad
might follow, then she had what she believed was a
wonderful inspiration, and she said with her usual
head-long impulsiveness: &ldquo;I do, indeed, know just
the very thing. You and I will start an old book
shop and you may be manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad&rsquo;s pale face flushed with pleasure. &ldquo;Do
you really mean it, Miss Vandergrift?&rdquo; he asked
eagerly. &ldquo;How I would like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her characteristic manner Bobs wanted to settle
the matter at once, and so she tripped downstairs
with Dean following.</p>
<p>She found that Gwendolyn had gone back to bed
and that the kitchen having been tidied, the three
girls were sitting about the fireplace talking softly
together. When they heard Bobs&rsquo; inspiration, they
all thought it a splendid plan, and Nell said that there
was a vacant room adjoining the office of the model
tenement that she had been told she might use in
any way that she wished. As there was a door
opening upon the street, she believed it would be an
ideal place for an old book shop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Rising, Nell continued: &ldquo;I will telephone Mrs.
Doran-Ashley at once to be sure that she is still willing
that I use the room as I desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was done, and that most kindly woman in
her beautiful home on Riverside Drive listened with
interest to the plan and gave the permission that
was requested. Moreover, upon leaving the telephone
she made a note in her engagement book: &ldquo;At
the next board meeting suggest that a visit be made
to the old book shop in the model tenement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Nell returned with the information that
they might do as they wished with the room, Bobs
and Dean went at once to a lumber yard near the
docks and ordered the shelves they would need. An
hour later Antovich and several of his boy companions
had carried the old books from the Pensinger
mansion and had heaped them upon the floor
of the pleasant vacant room, which opened directly
upon the sidewalk on Seventy-eighth Street.</p>
<p>When Bobs left, Dean was busy with hammer
and nails and happier, perhaps, than he had been in
the twenty years of his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">A CASE FOR TWO</span></h2>
<p>As Bobs left the small shop, she glanced at her
watch, and finding that it was nearly four, she
hastened her steps, recalling that that was the hour
when she might expect a call from the young lawyer.
As she turned the corner at the East River, she saw
a small, smart-looking auto drawing up at the curb
in front of the Pensinger mansion, and from it
leaped a fashionably groomed young man. Truly
an unusual sight in that part of New York&rsquo;s East
Side, where the clothes, ill-fitting even at best, descended
from father to son, often made smaller by
merely being haggled off at arm and ankle. No wonder
that Ralph Caldwaller-Cory was the object of
many an admiring glance from the dark eyes of the
young Hungarian women who, with gayly colored
shawls over their heads, at that moment were passing
on their way to the tobacco factory; but Ralph
was quite unconscious of their scrutiny, for, having
seen Bobs approaching, he hastened to meet her, hat
in hand, his good-looking, clean-shaven face glowing
with anticipation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found a clue as yet, Miss Vandergrift?&rdquo;
he asked eagerly, when greetings had been
exchanged.</p>
<p>Roberta laughed. &ldquo;No, and I&rsquo;ll have to confess
that I haven&rsquo;t given the matter a moment&rsquo;s thought
since we parted three hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all it has been? To me it has seemed
three centuries.&rdquo; The boy said this so sincerely that
Roberta believed that he must be greatly interested
in the Pensinger mystery. It did not enter her remotest
thought that he might also be interested in
her. Having reached the mansion, Bobs led the way
up the wide stone steps, saying: &ldquo;I do hope Gloria
and Lena May are at home. I want my sisters to
meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no one was to be seen. Gwen was still in
her room, while the other girls had not returned
from the Settlement House.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s another time coming.&rdquo; Bobs flashed
a smile at her companion, then led the way to the
wide fireplace, where comfortable chairs awaited
them, and they seated themselves facing the still
burning embers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Miss Vandergrift,&rdquo; Ralph began, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
a girl and you ought to know better than I just
what another girl, even though she lived seventy-five
years ago, would do under the circumstances with
which we are both familiar. If you loved a man,
of whom your mother did not approve, would you
really drown yourself, or would you marry him and
permit your parents to believe that you were dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs sat so long gazing into the fire that the
lad, earnestly watching her, wondered at her deep
thought.</p>
<p>At last she spoke. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have hurt my
mother that way,&rdquo; she said, and there were tears in
the hazel eyes that were lifted to her companion.
&ldquo;I would have known that her dearest desire would
be for my ultimate happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But mothers are different, we will have to confess,&rdquo;
the lad declared. &ldquo;Marilyn&rsquo;s may have thought
only of social fitness.&rdquo; Then, as he glanced about
the old salon and up at the huge crystal chandeliers,
he added: &ldquo;I judge that the Pensingers were people
of great wealth in those early days and probably
leaders in society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that they were,&rdquo; Roberta agreed, &ldquo;but
my mother had a different standard. She believed
that mental and soul companionship should be the
big thing in marriage, and for that matter, so do I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph felt awed. This was a very different girl
from the hoidenish young would-be detective with
whom he had so brief an acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Vandergrift,&rdquo; he said impulsively, &ldquo;I wish
I had a sister like you, and wouldn&rsquo;t my mother be
pleased, though, if you were her daughter. A girl,
I am sure, would have been more of a comfort and
companion to her when my brother Desmond died.&rdquo;
Then he added, after a moment of silence: &ldquo;I can
get your point of view, all right. I wouldn&rsquo;t break
my mother&rsquo;s heart by pretending to drown myself,
not even if the heavens fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know your mother,&rdquo; Roberta said.
&ldquo;She must be a wonderful woman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is!&rdquo; the lad declared. &ldquo;I want you to meet
her as soon as she returns. Just now she is touring
the West with friends, but, to get back to Marilyn
Pensinger. From the little that we know of her
family, I conclude that her mother was a snob and
placed social distinction above her daughter&rsquo;s happiness.
But, the very fact that the father made his
will as he did, proves, doesn&rsquo;t it, that he loved
his daughter more sincerely? He did not cut her
off with a shilling when he believed that she had
eloped with a foreign musician. Instead, he arranged
so that a descendant of that Hungarian, whose name
we do not even know, would inherit all that Mr.
Pensinger possessed. But this isn&rsquo;t getting us anywhere.
Do you happen to know anyone who has
recently come over from Hungary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs smiled. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be grasping at
straws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta thought a moment, then looked up
brightly. &ldquo;I believe I do. At least I know a Hungarian.
His name is Mr. Hardinian and he is doing
social welfare work. He speaks perfect English,
however, and may have been born in this country.
Suppose we go over to his clubhouse and interview
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Then, as she rose, she added: &ldquo;You will like Mr.
Hardinian. He has such beautiful eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph laughed as he also arose. &ldquo;Is that a girl&rsquo;s
reason for liking a man?&rdquo; he inquired. Then he
added, &ldquo;Would I were a Hungarian that I might
have interesting eyes. As it is, mine are the plain,
unromantic American variety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta smiled at her new friend, but what she
said showed that her thought was far from the
subject: &ldquo;Before we go, I want to be sure that my
sister, Gwen, is comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwendolyn was sleeping so quietly that Roberta
believed she would not awaken before Lena May&rsquo;s
return, and so, beckoning the lad to follow, she left
the house, closing the door softly. Ralph turned
and looked back at the upper windows of the rooms
that were not occupied, as he inquired: &ldquo;Do you
have a hunch that the old mansion holds the clue we
are seeking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta&rsquo;s reply was: &ldquo;Only the ghost of Marilyn
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>When the two partner-detectives were in the small,
luxurious car, and going very slowly, because of the
congested traffic down First Avenue, Ralph said:
&ldquo;Tell me a little about your sisters and yourself that
I may feel better acquainted.&rdquo; And so, briefly,
Roberta told the story of their coming to the East
Side to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Miss Vandergrift, that certainly was hard
luck, losing the fine old place that your family had
supposed was its own for so many generations.&rdquo;
Then the lad added with sincere admiration: &ldquo;You
girls certainly are trumps! I&rsquo;m mighty glad I met
you, and I hope you&rsquo;ll be glad, too, some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Caldwaller-Cory, I&rsquo;m glad right this
very moment,&rdquo; Roberta assured him in so impersonal
a manner that the lad did not feel greatly
flattered. Indeed, he was rather pleased that this
was so. Being the son of a famous judge, possessed
of good looks, charming manners and all the
money he wished to spend, Ralph had been greatly
sought after by the fond mothers of the girls in his
set, if not by the maidens themselves, and it seemed
rather an interesting change to meet a girl whose
interest in him was not personal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>After a silent moment in which the lad&rsquo;s entire
attention had been centered on extricating his small
auto from a crush of trucks, vegetable-laden push-carts
and foreign pedestrians, he turned and smiled
at his companion. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn over to Central Park
now,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little round about, I&rsquo;ll
agree, but it will be pleasanter riding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was decidedly out of their way, but a glance at
her wrist watch assured Roberta that Lena May
would have returned to be with Gwen by that time,
and so she was in no especial hurry.</p>
<p>How beautiful the park seemed after the thronged
noisy East Side with its mingled odors from tobacco,
fish markets, and general squalor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now we can talk,&rdquo; Ralph said as he drove
slowly along one of the winding avenues under a
canopy formed by wide-spreading trees. &ldquo;What shall
it be about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; Roberta replied. &ldquo;Tell me about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to tell,&rdquo; the lad began. &ldquo;My
brother Desmond and I grew up in a happy home.
During the winter months we attended a boys&rsquo; school
up the Hudson, and each summer vacation we traveled
with our parents. We have been about everywhere,
I do believe. Desmond and I were all in all
to each other. We were twins. Perhaps that was
why we seemed to love each other even more than
brothers usually do. I did not feel the need of any
other boy companion, and when at last we entered
college we were permitted to be roommates. In our
Sophomore year, Desmond died, and I didn&rsquo;t much
care what happened after that. It seemed as though
I never could room with another chap; but at last
the dormitories were so crowded that I had to take
a fellow in. That was two years ago, and today
Dick De Laney is as close to me as Desmond was,
almost, not quite, of course. No one will ever be
that. But, I tell you, Miss Vandergrift, Dick is a
fine chap, clear through to the core. I&rsquo;d bank on
Dick&rsquo;s doing the honorable thing, come what might.
I&rsquo;m a year older than he is, and he won&rsquo;t finish until
June, then he&rsquo;s coming on here to little old New
York and spend a month with me. I say, Miss Vandergrift,
I&rsquo;d like to have you meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Roberta smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you to
come to a period that I might tell you that Dick
De Laney and I were playmates when we wore pinafores.
You see, they were our next-door neighbors.&rdquo;
Bobs said this in so matter-of-fact a tone that Ralph
did not think for one moment that this could be the
girl his pal had once told him that he loved and
hoped to win.</p>
<p>If only Ralph had realized this, much so
might have been saved for one of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">PARTNER-DETECTIVES</span></h2>
<p>It was five-thirty when the partner-detectives left
the quiet park, where long shadows were lying
on the grass and where birds were calling softly
from one rustling tree to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems like a different world, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Bobs
said, as she smiled in her friendliest way at the lad
at the wheel. She had felt a real tenderness for her
companion since he had told her about Desmond, and
she was glad that an old friend of hers had been a
comfort to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does, indeed,&rdquo; he declared with a last glance
back at the park. &ldquo;I like trees better than I do many
people. We have some wonderful old elms around
our summer home in the Orange Hills. When my
mother returns I shall ask her to invite you four
girls to one of her week-ends, or to one that she
will plan just for me, after Dick comes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Then, as they were again on the thronged East
Side, the lad said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-sixth Street, beyond Second, you said,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There is the Boys&rsquo; Club House just ahead,&rdquo;
Roberta exclaimed. Then as they drew up at the
curb, she added: &ldquo;Good! The door is open and so
Mr. Hardinian probably is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man whom they sought was still there,
and as they entered the low wooden temporary structure
which covered a vacant lot between two rickety
old tenements, they saw him smiling down at a group
of excited newsies, who were evidently relating to
him some occurrence of their day.</p>
<p>He at once recognized Roberta and made his way
toward her, while the boys to whom he had spoken
a few words of dismissal departed through a side
door, leaving the big room empty.</p>
<p>Bobs held out her hand as she said: &ldquo;Mr. Hardinian,
this is my friend, Mr. Caldwaller-Cory, and
we have come, I do believe, on a wild goose chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph at once liked the young man with the lithe,
wiry build and the dark face that was so wonderfully
expressive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>He looked to be about twenty-four years of age,
although he might have been even a year or two
older. An amused smile accompanied his question:
&ldquo;Miss Vandergrift, am I the wild goose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t a very graceful
way of stating our errand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so I will begin
again. The truth of the matter is that Mr. Cory
and I are amateur detectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Mr. Hardinian smiled, and, with a swinging
gesture that seemed to include the entire place,
he said: &ldquo;Search where you will, but I doubt if
you will detect here a hidden wild goose.&rdquo; Then,
more seriously, he added: &ldquo;Come, let us be seated in
the library corner, for I am sure that your visit has
some real purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Mr. Hardinian listened to the story of the Pensinger
mystery, which, as little was really known
about it, took but a brief moment to tell. At its
conclusion he said: &ldquo;Did you think. Miss Vandergrift,
that I might know something about all this?
I truly do not. Although I was born in Hungary,
while I was still an infant my parents went to England,
where I was educated, and only last year the
need of my own people brought me here where so
many of them come, believing that they are to find
freedom and fortune. But how soon they are disillusioned,
for they find poverty, suffering and conditions
to which they are unused and with which
they know not how to cope. Many of the older
ones lose out and their children are left waifs all
alone in this great city. I found when I reached here
that they needed me most, the homeless boys who,
many of them, slept huddled over some grating
through which heat came, or in hallways crowded
together for warmth, until they were told to move
on. And so the first thing that I did was to rent this
vacant lot and build a temporary wooden structure.
Now with these walls lined with bunks, as you see,
I can make many of the boys fairly comfortable at
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Mr. Hardinian,&rdquo; Ralph exclaimed, &ldquo;this
is a splendid work that you are doing! I&rsquo;m coming
over some night soon, if I may. I want to see the
place in full swing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come whenever you wish,&rdquo; was the reply. And
then, as Roberta had risen, the young men did also.</p>
<p>The girl smiled as she said: &ldquo;Honestly, Mr. Hardinian,
I knew in my bones that you would not be
able to help us solve the mystery, but you were the
only Hungarian with whom I had even the slightest
speaking acquaintance, and so we thought that we
would tell you the story and, if you ever hear anything
that might be a clue, let us know, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will, and gladly. Good-bye! Come
over Sunday afternoon at four, if you have no other
plans. We have a little service then and the boys
conduct it entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were again in the small car, Ralph
was enthusiastic. &ldquo;I like that chap!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I wish detectives could plan to have things turn out
the way an author can. If I had the say of it, I&rsquo;d
make Mr. Hardinian into a descendant of Marilyn
Pensinger and then he could inherit all of that fortune
and use it for his homeless waifs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was after six when the small car stopped in
front of the Pensinger mansion, and Ralph declared
that since he had a date with his dad, he could not
stop to meet the other Vandergrift girls, as he
greatly desired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>That night, when Ralph returned from an evening
affair which he had attended with his father, he did
not retire at once. Instead, he seated himself at his
desk and for half an hour his pen scratched rapidly
over a large sheet of white paper. He was writing
a letter to Dick De Laney, his close-as-a-brother
friend, telling him that at last the only girl in the
world had appeared in his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always told you, old pal, that I&rsquo;d know the girl
who was meant for me the minute that I met her.
But I do believe that she is going to be hard to win.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">ROMANCE BUDDING</span></h2>
<p>Two weeks have passed since the evening upon
which Bobs and her new friend, Ralph Caldwaller-Cory,
drove together in Central Park and told each
other briefly the story of their lives. It does not take
interested young people long to become acquainted
and these two had many opportunities to be together,
for were they not solving the Pensinger
mystery, and was it not of paramount importance
that the poor defrauded heir of all those idle millions
should be found and made happy with his rightful
possessions? Of course no other motive prompted
Ralph, the rising young lawyer, to seek the companionship
of his detective-partner, not only daily
but often, in the morning, afternoon and evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>They had sought clues everywhere in the mansion,
but the great old rooms had failed to reveal aught
that was concealed. Too, they had long drives in
the little red car that its owner called &ldquo;The Whizz,&rdquo;
and these frequently took them far away from the
thronged East Side along country roads where, quite
undisturbed, they could talk over possible clues and
plan ways to follow them.</p>
<p>And all this time Roberta really thought that
Ralph&rsquo;s interest in her was impersonal, for the lad
dreaded revealing his true feeling until she showed
some even remote sign of being interested in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I tell Bobs that I care for her, it might queer
the whole thing,&rdquo; was one thought suggested to him
as he rode home alone one night through the quiet
park. Another thought was more encouraging. It
suggested, &ldquo;But a girl&rsquo;s pride won&rsquo;t let her show
that she cares. There is only one way to find out,
and that is to ask.&rdquo; And still another assured him,
&ldquo;There is every reason why Roberta Vandergrift
should be pleased. You, Ralph, have wealth and
position, and can restore to her all that she has lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots you know about Bobs,&rdquo; the lad blurted out
as though someone really had spoken to him. &ldquo;My
opinion is that Roberta isn&rsquo;t really grown up enough
as yet to think of love. She considers her boy
friends more as brothers, and that&rsquo;s what they ought
to be, first and foremost. I&rsquo;ll bide my time, but if
I do lose Bobs, it will be like losing Desmond all
over again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Meanwhile, although no progress had been made
in solving the mystery, much progress was being
made in other directions.</p>
<p>Gloria, with Bobs and Ralph, had attended a Sunday
afternoon meeting of the Boy&rsquo;s Club and Mr.
Hardinian had walked home with them and had
remained for tea. He was very glad to have an
opportunity to talk with a young woman whose interest
in welfare work paralleled his own, especially
as he had one rather wayward boy whom he believed
needed mothering more than all else.</p>
<p>Gloria&rsquo;s heart indeed was touched when she heard
the sad story that the young man had to tell, and
she gladly offered to do what she could.</p>
<p>She invited the wayward boy to one of her game
evenings at the Settlement House, and in teaching
him to play honestly she not only won his ardent
devotion but also saved him from being sent to the
island reformatory for petty thievery.</p>
<p>After that Mr. Hardinian frequently called upon
Gloria when he needed advice or help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>The little old book shop, during the eventful two
weeks, had started, or so it would seem, on a very
successful business career.</p>
<p>Because of the little memorandum that she had
made in her note book on the day that Nell Wiggin
had first telephoned to her, Mrs. Doran-Ashley did
tell the ladies who attended the next model tenement
board meeting about the shop, and asked them to
visit it, which they did, being sincerely interested in
all that pertained to their venture. And not only did
they buy books, but they left others to be sold on
commission. One glance at the fine face of the lad
who was bookseller made them realize that, crippled
as he might be, he would not accept charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s business this hot day?&rdquo; Bobs asked early
one morning, as she poked her head in at the door.
She was on her way down to the Fourth Avenue
Branch of the Burns Detective Agency, where she
went every day to do a few hours&rsquo; secretarial work
for Mr. Jewett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a splendid trade yesterday,&rdquo; the lad
replied, as he looked up from the old book of poetry
which he was reading. And yet, since he held a
pencil, Bobs concluded that he was also writing verse
as the inspiration came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The shop had a visit from no less a personage
than Mr. Van Loon, the millionaire book collector,
of whom you told me. He bought several volumes
that I hadn&rsquo;t supposed were worth a farthing, and
what he paid for them will more than cover our
expenses up to date. I wonder how he happened to
know about this out-of-the-way shop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess he goes nosing around after old
books, sort of ferrets them out, like as not. Well,
so long! I&rsquo;m mighty glad our shop is financially on
its feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Bobs went on her way down the crowded First
Avenue she smiled to herself, for it was she who
had sent Mr. Van Loon a business-like letter announcing
the opening of an old book shop, feeling
sure that he would not miss an opportunity of seeing
it if it held something that he might desire.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes after her departure, Dean again
heard the door open, and this time a dear little boy
of three darted in and hid beneath a book-covered
counter, peering out to whisper delightedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;se
hidin&rsquo;! Miss May, her&rsquo;s arter me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Almost immediately the pursuer, who was Lena
May Vandergrift, appeared in the doorway. The
young bookseller was on his feet at once and there
was a sudden light in the dreamy brown eyes that
told its own story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Dean,&rdquo; the girl said. &ldquo;Have you
seen Antony Wilovich? I told him to wait out in
front for me so that he could escort me to the Settlement
House this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dean smiled knowingly and replied, which was
his part of the game: &ldquo;Well, well, has that little
scamp run away again somewhere, and hidden? I
guess he doesn&rsquo;t love his Miss May or he wouldn&rsquo;t
do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This always proved too much for the little fellow
in hiding, and from under the counter he would
dart, his arms extended. Then the girl, stopping,
would catch him in a loving embrace. &ldquo;I do so love
Miss May,&rdquo; the child would protest. &ldquo;I loves her
next most to my muvver over dere.&rdquo; A chubby
finger would point, or the golden head would nod,
in the direction of the rickety tumble-down tenement
across the way, the very one which Miss Selenski,
the former agent of the model tenement, had called
a &ldquo;fire trap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>This little game of hide-and-seek took place every
morning, for Lena May had promised the &ldquo;muvver
over dere,&rdquo; who was slowly dying of consumption,
that she would call for Tony, take him to the Settlement
sandpile and return him safely at noon.</p>
<p>If this was a merry moment each day for little
Tony, it was to Dean Wiggin much more. The
sweet, sympathetic girl, in her pretty muslin dress
and flower-wreathed hat, suggested to the lad from
the country all that he most loved, the fragrance of
blossoms, the song of birds, and the peace of the
meadow-pool at noon time. When she was gone,
with a friendly backward nod at the crippled bookseller,
he would always read poetry or try to write
one that would express what Lena May was to him,
to little Tony, or to the invalid mother who trusted
her with her one treasure.</p>
<p>And so that two weeks had raised the curtain upon
three dreams, but one of them was to become a
tragedy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">A SUDDEN DEPARTURE</span></h2>
<p>Time&mdash;A week later.</p>
<hr /><p>&ldquo;Hello, Bobs, is that you?&rdquo; But it was Lena
May who had answered an imperative ring at the
telephone, and so she replied, &ldquo;Oh, good morning,
Mr. Caldwaller-Cory. No, I am not Roberta. I will
call her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Ralph knew that he was talking
to the girl whom he loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Bobety,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;will you go for
a drive with me right away this minute? Please say
&lsquo;yes&rsquo; (for she had hesitated), I have something of
great importance to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, I can&rsquo;t, Ralph,&rdquo; was the earnest reply.
&ldquo;I am going to give Lena May a holiday. She and
Dean Wiggin are going to take little Tony Wilovich
to Bronx Park and spend the day. The little fellow
is wild to see the monkeys and Lena May needs a
day among the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Her youngest sister was at her elbow whispering,
&ldquo;We can go some other time, dear, if there&rsquo;s something
that you want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Roberta shook her head. There was a brief
silence at the other end of the line, then the lad spoke
again. &ldquo;I say, Bobs, how are they going? On the
L! That&rsquo;s what I thought. Suppose I get Dad&rsquo;s
big car. We can take them out to the park and
then on the way back you and I can have the visit
I want. In fact I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to see you, Bobs. It&rsquo;s terribly
important to me. I&rsquo;m all cut up about something
that has happened and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta knew by her friend&rsquo;s voice that something
had occurred to trouble him greatly, and so she said:
&ldquo;Wait a moment, Ralph. I will talk it over with my
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena May thought the plan a good one and Ralph
was told to be at the Pensinger mansion in one-half
hour with the car and they would all be ready and
waiting for him.</p>
<p>Lena May then departed to the rickety tenement
to get the wee lad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Wilovich,&rdquo; the girl said, as she looked
about the small, hot room. &ldquo;How I do wish that
you would go with us today. Don&rsquo;t you feel strong
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dearie, thanks though. The coughin&rsquo; spell
was harder&rsquo;n usual this mornin&rsquo;. &rsquo;Twas all as I could
do to get Tony&rsquo;s breakfast. I&rsquo;ll be that happy
knowin&rsquo; as the little fellow&rsquo;s seein&rsquo; the monkeys his
heart&rsquo;s been set on ever since the picture posters was
up on the fences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later the girl and the little boy were
joined by the young bookseller on Seventy-eighth
Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dean,&rdquo; Lena May said sadly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
that Mrs. Wilovich will be with us one month from
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; the lad replied; then he added, as he
looked at the curly-headed three-year-old, who had
darted ahead but who looked back, laughing at them,
&ldquo;What will become of Tony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to keep him, somehow. Gloria has
given her permission. I wanted to be sure that Sister
thought my plan wise that I might know just what
to say to the little mother when she speaks of it to
me, as she will in time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>No wonder was it that the lad&rsquo;s unspoken love for
the girl took unto itself the qualities of adoration.
&ldquo;She is too sweet and too good to be loved by a
useless man such as I am,&rdquo; he thought, and how he
wished that his muscle-bound arm might be freed
that he could work and fight the world for this angel
of a girl. A surgeon had once told him that there
was really nothing wrong with his arm. It had
grown with the passing years, but was stiffened from
long disuse.</p>
<p>Tony was wildly excited when he saw the big
green car in which he was to ride for the first time
in his short life, and he entertained them all with
his chatter.</p>
<p>Roberta, sitting on the front seat with her friend,
glanced often at his face and realized that, although
he, too, joined in the laughter evoked by the baby&rsquo;s
prattle, his thoughts were of a very serious nature,
and she wondered what she was to hear when they
two were alone.</p>
<p>She little dreamed that Ralph was to say something
that would greatly affect her.</p>
<p>Dean, carrying the basket which was well filled
with picnic refreshments, and Lena May leading the
shining eyed three-year-old, waved back at the big
car as they entered the side gate of the woodsy
Bronx Park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Bobs smiled as the baby voice wafted to them,
&ldquo;Ohee, see funny cow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were near the buffalo enclosure.</p>
<p>Then Ralph started the engine and slowly the car
rolled along the little river and toward the country.
Roberta, knowing that something was greatly troubling
her friend, reached out a hand and laid it sympathetically
upon his arm. Instantly his left hand
closed over hers and his eyes turned toward her
questioningly. &ldquo;Bobs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been a
trump of a friend to me. I&rsquo;m not going to try to
tell you just now what it means. It&rsquo;s another friend
I want to talk about. Dick&mdash;Dick De Laney. You
remember that I told you he has become almost as
dear to me as a brother, since Desmond died. I was
sure Dick would do anything for me. I had such
faith in his loyalty, in his devoted friendship, but
now he has done something I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
Ralph paused and his companion saw that he was
greatly affected. &ldquo;Bobs, I&rsquo;m taking this awfully
hard. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Roberta was amazed. What had her old pal, Dick
De Laney, done to so hurt her new friend? &ldquo;Why,
Ralph dear,&rdquo; she said, for he had turned away as
though too overcome with emotion for the moment
to go on with his story. &ldquo;What has Dick done?
I know that it is nothing disloyal or dishonorable.
You don&rsquo;t know Dick as I do if you can doubt him
for one moment. He would do what he believed
was right, even if the consequences were to bring
real suffering to him. He&rsquo;s been that way ever since
he was a little fellow. You may take my word for
it, Ralph, that whatever Dick has done, his motive
is of the highest. Now tell me what has hurt you so
deeply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; the lad began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed
Dick terribly, more, of course, before I met you,
but I have been looking eagerly forward to the
month he was to spend with me in the Orange Hills.
I didn&rsquo;t tell you that I expected him to arrive today.
I wanted to surprise you, but instead I received
a letter on the early morning mail and it informed
me that, although the writer really did love me as
though I were his brother, he thought it best not to
visit me this summer; instead he had decided to
travel abroad indefinitely and that he had engaged
passage on a steamer that leaves Hoboken at noon
today. What can it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>The lad turned and was amazed at the expression
in the face of the girl. &ldquo;Why, Bobs,&rdquo; he blurted
out, &ldquo;can it be&mdash;do you care so much because Dick
is going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ralph, of course I care. It&rsquo;s all my fault.
I knew Dick loved me. I guess I&rsquo;ve always known
it, and last April, when he was home for the spring
vacation, I promised him that&mdash;Oh, I don&rsquo;t remember
just what I did promise, but I do know that I
haven&rsquo;t written often of late, and I guess he thinks
I don&rsquo;t care any more; and maybe that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s
going away; but I do care, and, oh, Ralph, I can&rsquo;t
let him go without telling him. I always meant to
tell him when he came home from college. I thought
we were too young to be really engaged until then.
Dick has been so patient, waiting all these years, and
loving me so truly and so loyally. Can&rsquo;t we stop
him, or&mdash;at least can&rsquo;t we see him before he sails?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression in the fine face of the lad at her
side plainly told the struggle that was going on
within his heart. So, after all, Dick De Laney had
been as loyal as a brother. He was going away to
give Ralph a clear field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Well, it was Ralph&rsquo;s turn now to show the mettle
he was made of. In a voice that might have betrayed
his emotion if Roberta had not been so concerned
with her own anxiety and regrets, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Bobs, we will try to reach the boat
before it sails. We&rsquo;ll ferry over to the Jersey side
and then we&rsquo;ll break the speed limit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">A HAPPY REUNION</span></h2>
<p>Dick De Laney was leaning over the railing of
the big liner that was to take him away from the
country that was home to him and from the girl he
loved, whose happiness meant more to him than did
his own, but, as he looked out over the choppy
waters of the bay and toward the broad Atlantic
he could see ahead of him nothing but years of
loneliness.</p>
<p>Then it was that he heard a voice that was
eagerly, tremulously calling his name. He whirled
and beheld Roberta back of him, her hands outstretched.
There were tears in her eyes as she said:
&ldquo;Dick, why did you do it? Why did you plan going
away without saying good-bye? Even if you have
changed your mind, even if you don&rsquo;t care for me
any more, it isn&rsquo;t like you to just run away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s face, troubled at first, was radiant when
the full meaning of the words reached his consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bobs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why, Bobita, I thought you
didn&rsquo;t care; that is, I thought maybe you loved
Ralph, and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you were going away to let me have
someone else, you dear old stupid! To think that
I so nearly lost you just because I was so very sure
that you loved me; that I never could lose you, and
so I didn&rsquo;t write about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These two were holding each other&rsquo;s hands and
looking deep into each other&rsquo;s eyes, entirely oblivious
of their surroundings. Roberta continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dicky-boy, I&rsquo;ve had my lesson, and when we are
married, every day the first thing, instead of good
morning, I am going to say I love you, which, after
all, will mean the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married, Bobs! When are we to be married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed at the lad&rsquo;s eagerness, but as
many passengers were appearing on deck, she
replied, demurely, &ldquo;Sometime, of course, and live
happily ever after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was hard for Dick not to shout, but, instead,
he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, dear, and I&rsquo;ll cancel my passage,
and then I&rsquo;ll go home with you and tell you what all
this means to me. I can&rsquo;t very well here.&rdquo; Then,
as he glanced about, he inquired: &ldquo;How did you get
here, Bobs? Did you come alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ralph brought me.&rdquo; Her conscience rebuked
her, for she had completely forgotten the existence
of her other friend. &ldquo;He was as hurt as I was
because you were going away without seeing him,&rdquo;
she told Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Ralph,&rdquo; was all he said. &ldquo;I certainly
am sorry for him, but I suppose it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry for Ralph? Why?&rdquo; Roberta&rsquo;s expression
of surprised inquiry was so frank that the lad
knew his pal had never spoken of his love.</p>
<p>Dick was even more puzzled when, upon reaching
the dock, he saw his friend Ralph leap toward them
with hands outstretched. Joyfully he exclaimed:
&ldquo;Great. I know by your radiant faces that you&rsquo;ve
made up. I congratulate you both. I certainly am
glad that we made it on time.&rdquo; Then after a hearty
hand-shaking: &ldquo;What put that wild notion of flight
into your head, old man? You can&rsquo;t get rid of us
that easy, can he, Bobs? My detective-partner here
has been telling me that she has been engaged to you
ever since she wore pinafores, or was it a little
later?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Roberta laughed. &ldquo;I believe I had on a riding
habit that day, didn&rsquo;t I, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph turned away after a fleeting glance at the
girl&rsquo;s face as it was uplifted to his roommate. He
had not dreamed that she could be as beautiful as
that expression of love had made her.</p>
<p>Dick was replying, &ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t much matter
when it happened, dear. The big thing is that it did
happen at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, when they were in the big green car (the
front seat was wide enough to hold all three of
them), Dick began to ask questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is Gwen now?&rdquo; was the first of them. He
was pleased to hear that the girl, but a year Roberta&rsquo;s
senior, was much better and visiting his sister,
Phyllis.</p>
<p>Then it was that Bobs thought of something.
&ldquo;Why, Ralph,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you never did have an
opportunity to meet my beautiful sister, Gwendolyn,
did you? She hasn&rsquo;t been strong enough to visit
with strangers, and now she has gone away for a
whole month.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Dick smiled as he said to the driver: &ldquo;Bobs is
giving herself a compliment when she calls Gwendolyn
beautiful, for the family resemblance between
the two girls is very striking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta laughed. &ldquo;I should say that it must be,
Dick. Did I ever write you about the time a stage
manager thought that I <i>was</i> Gwen, and I actually
had to do a song and dance? I laugh every time
I think of it. Gloria said afterwards that it was a
natural mistake, for though I am not as sylph-like
as my sister, we do look very much the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph smiled, but he made no response. His
thought was commenting: &ldquo;As though anyone
could be like you, Bobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was noon when the Pensinger mansion was
reached, and Roberta told the lads that she wasn&rsquo;t
going to ask them in just then, as she had to do
some writing for Mr. Jewett that must be delivered
that afternoon, but she invited them both to supper,
if they weren&rsquo;t afraid to eat her cooking. Dick
said he certainly would reappear as soon as she would
permit him to come, but Ralph had an engagement
with his Dad. As that was not unusual, Bobs did
not think that this time it was an excuse to remain
away, as indeed it was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Roberta turned at the house door to wave to the
lads in the car that was starting away. Vaguely she
wondered what they would talk about. How little
she knew of the aching heart that one of them was
so bravely trying to hide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">REVELATIONS THAT DO NOT REVEAL</span></h2>
<p>The two lads who were close as brothers rode for
some time in silence after having left Roberta at the
Pensinger mansion. It took skillful driving to cross
the crowded streets at First, Second and Third, but
after that the way was open to Central Park and,
when at last they were riding down one of the wide,
tree-shaded avenues, Ralph turned his gaze from the
road and smiled at his friend.</p>
<p>The eyes of Dick were searching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all this means what, to you?&rdquo; he asked
earnestly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That I wrote the letter to which you are referring,
hastily, on an impulse, before I was really
acquainted with Miss Vandergrift. I know now
that she isn&rsquo;t the girl for me, and I also know that
she <i>is</i> the girl for you, and I sincerely congratulate
you both. Now I say, Dick, you aren&rsquo;t going to
spoil my plans for a house party in the Orange Hills
by bolting, are you? Ma Mere will be back tomorrow,
and she wrote that I might have my friends for
a week as soon as the house has been aired out.
You know it has been closed all winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo; Dick felt
greatly relieved, for he believed that Ralph was telling
him the truth. He knew that his college pal
was impulsive and often did things in more of a
headlong manner than he would had he given the
matter thought. &ldquo;Of course he admires my Bobs;
no one could help that, but I&rsquo;m glad that he doesn&rsquo;t
really love her,&rdquo; Dick was thinking. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had sorrow
enough as it is.&rdquo; Aloud he asked, &ldquo;Who are
you going to ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I did invite all four of the Vandergrift
girls, but Bobs is the only one who has accepted.
The oldest and youngest sisters are free but a few
hours each day; the rest of their time they devote to
Settlement work and they feel that they are especially
needed now that it is vacation in the schools.
Gwendolyn, however, may come, as of course I have
invited your sister Phyllis and her guests.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Dick looked at Ralph with the light of a new
inspiration in his eyes. &ldquo;I say, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great
if you could care for my sister Phyl? Then you
would be my brother in very truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph laughed. &ldquo;Dicky-boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are you
turning matchmaker? It&rsquo;s too late for that, old
man. Bobs tells me that Phyllis is engaged to a fine
chap from up Boston way. His name is Arden
Wentworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s great news! Arden is a chap after
my own heart, but I didn&rsquo;t think that he ever could
win Phyl. She must have changed a lot this last
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Ralph looked around inquiringly.
&ldquo;His father has piled up a few millions. That
ought to please any girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where the shoe pinches, so to speak,&rdquo;
was the reply. &ldquo;Arden, being a red-blooded young
American, refused to just spend his father&rsquo;s money
and so he put on overalls and began at the bottom
in one of his dad&rsquo;s factories. He said he wanted to
prove to himself, even if the world didn&rsquo;t care, that
he had brains enough to make good without help.
Phyl wouldn&rsquo;t speak to him after that, hoping that,
for her sake, he would give it up; but he didn&rsquo;t, and
so I thought it was all off between them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, something must have happened, for Bobs
tells me that they are really engaged, and so, of
course I have also invited Arden. By the way, you
know Gwendolyn Vandergrift. What kind of a
chap ought I to ask for her? Harry Birch is in
town. I thought she might like him.&rdquo; And so the
lads talked over the plans for the coming house party,
and so successfully did Ralph play his part that his
pal did not for one moment suspect that his friend
was secretly wishing that he might have sailed away
in Dick&rsquo;s place on the boat which, that noon, had
left for distant shores.</p>
<p>But night is darkest before the dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE HOUSE PARTY</span></h2>
<p>Ralph and Dick were out on the wide velvety
lawn which surrounded the handsome rambling
summer home of the Caldwaller-Corys.</p>
<p>The gay awnings, palms and boxes of flowers gave
the house a festive appearance, while the many colored
lanterns strung about the garden suggested that
some merriment was planned for the evening.</p>
<p>Mrs. Caldwaller-Cory, who seemed very young to
be the mother of a junior member of an ancient law
firm, emerged from the house closely followed by
Roberta Vandergrift.</p>
<p>Bobs, in an attractive summer dress and wide
flower-wreathed hat, looked very different from the
girl who, while on the East Side, dressed in a simple
dark tailor-made suit and a neat, narrow-brimmed
hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t your guests late, my son?&rdquo; the hostess
inquired. Ralph looked at his watch for the tenth
time in as many minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly are,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;late by a full hour
now, and I am almost inclined to think that they
had a breakdown. They were coming in Jack Beardsley&rsquo;s
tallyho, and he said he would time the drive
from New York so that they would reach us
promptly at two-thirty, and now it is nearing four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment a butler crossed the lawn and,
beckoning Ralph to one side, told him that someone
awaited him at the telephone. Excusing himself, the
lad fairly ran indoors. As he had expected, it was
the voice of his friend, Jack Beardsley, that greeted
him. &ldquo;I say, Ralph, are you alone so that no one
will get wise to what I am going to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to worry her sister needlessly.
There really is no cause for that, but we&rsquo;ve been
delayed at the Orange Hills Inn because Gwendolyn
Vandergrift, who isn&rsquo;t as strong as she thought, has
found riding in the tallyho too hard. She&rsquo;s got grit,
that girl has! Never complained, but kept up as
long as she could that she need not trouble anyone
until she just keeled over and fainted. She&rsquo;s better
now, and Phyllis thought that if you would come
over after her with that little runabout of yours,
made comfortable with blankets and pillows, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be as hard for Miss Vandergrift as this
old tallyho of mine. Mrs. Buscom, the innkeeper&rsquo;s
wife, will look out for her, and so, if you are coming,
we&rsquo;ll start along, as I want to make the steep grade
with this lumbering vehicle of mine before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, I&rsquo;ll get there all right. I&rsquo;ll take a
short cut through the hills, so you won&rsquo;t pass me,
but don&rsquo;t be alarmed. I&rsquo;ll probably get back here in
The Whizz as soon as you do in the tallyho, so I
won&rsquo;t say anything to her sister, Roberta, as yet.
So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Ralph was acting on impulse. His first
desire had been to take Bobs with him, but if he did
there would not be room to make the invalid sister
comfortable on the return trip, and, moreover, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to Dick.</p>
<p>His dad wouldn&rsquo;t arrive with the big car until
five-thirty, and so The Whizz would have to do.
Sending word out to the group on the lawn that the
tallyho had been delayed but would soon arrive,
Ralph donned his leather coat, cap and goggles and
made his way out through a back entrance and down
to the garage. Soon thereafter he was speeding over
a country road which led among the hills and was a
short cut of many miles to the Inn. He broke the
speed limit whenever the dirt road was smooth
enough to permit him to do so, but, although he
frightened many a flock of birds from the hedges,
no one arose from the wayside tangle to bid him go
more slowly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>When at last he drew up at the Inn, the kind Mrs.
Buscom appeared and smilingly informed him that
the young lady was quite rested and that the tallyho
had been gone for half an hour. She was about to
lead the way into the dim, old-fashioned parlor of
the Inn when new arrivals delayed her, and so Ralph
went in alone.</p>
<p>The blinds in the old-fashioned parlor of the Inn
were drawn, and, having come in from the dazzling
sunshine, Ralph at first could scarcely see, but a girl,
who had been seated in a haircloth rocker, arose and
advanced toward him. She wore a rose-colored linen
hat and dress. For a moment the lad paused and
stared as though at an apparition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bobs!&rdquo; he ejaculated. Then he laughed as he
extended his hand. &ldquo;Miss Vandergrift, honestly,
just for a second I thought that I was seeing a
vision. I had quite forgotten that you and your
sister so closely resemble each other, though, to be
sure, you are taller than Bobs; but pardon me for
not introducing myself. I am Ralph Cory, of whom,
perhaps, you have heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am Gwendolyn Vandergrift, of whom
I am sure that you have heard, else you would not
have come for me,&rdquo; the girl smiled; and, to his
amazement, Ralph found that his heart was pounding
like a trip-hammer. &ldquo;If you are sure that you
are rested, Miss Vandergrift,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will
start back at once. I&rsquo;ve brought soft pillows galore,
and a jolly soft lap robe. I do hope you&rsquo;ll be comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the porch of the Inn, Gwen turned and, holding
out a frail hand, she said to the kindly woman:
&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Buscom, for having taken such
good care of me. I shall stop again on our way
back to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bustling little woman helped arrange the pillows
and tucked in the blanket. Then to Ralph she
said as the machinery started: &ldquo;Do take care of the
pretty dear. It&rsquo;s like a flower she is, and ought to
be sheltered from the rough winds of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that little thing, Mrs. Buscom. Good-bye.
Wish us luck!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Ralph drove slowly at first, but Gwen said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
so well packed in pillows, Mr. Cory, it won&rsquo;t jar me
in the least if you go faster.&rdquo; And so the speed
increased. It was late afternoon and the highway
was deserted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to overtake the tallyho,&rdquo;
Ralph remarked. &ldquo;If I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t mind
the pace we&rsquo;d have to hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwendolyn smiled up trustingly. &ldquo;I have perfect
faith in your driving,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know you will
take care of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph, looking into the face of the girl at his side,
again had the strange feeling that it was Bobs, only
different, and&mdash;Oh, what was the matter with him,
anyway? Was it possible that he liked the
difference?</p>
<p>Bobs had always been a frank comrade, more like
another boy, when he came to think of it, but this
girl, who was equally beautiful, was depending upon
him to take good care of her.</p>
<p>A fifteen-minute spurt brought them to the top
of a hill and in the valley below they saw the
tallyho.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Ralph stopped a brief moment on the plateau,
leaped out to be sure that The Whizz was in perfect
condition, and then anxiously inquired, &ldquo;Are you
sure you&rsquo;re game? Loop the loop won&rsquo;t be in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwen nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll like it,&rdquo; she assured him.
The color had mounted to her cheeks and her eyes
sparkled. &ldquo;All right! Hold fast! Here goes!&rdquo;
Then The Whizz went like a red streak down that
hill on which, as Ralph had observed from the top,
there was nothing to impede their progress.</p>
<p>They overtook the tallyho and slowed up that they
need not startle the horses. They had reached the
outer boundaries of the Caldwaller-Cory estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I get back in the tallyho with the
others,&rdquo; Gwen said, &ldquo;then Bobs won&rsquo;t know that I
had a fainting spell. If she knew it, she would feel
that she ought to take me right home, and I don&rsquo;t
want to go.&rdquo; Her smile at Ralph seemed to imply
that he was her fellow-conspirator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you go,&rdquo; he heard himself
saying.</p>
<p>So the change was made. Ralph turned The
Whizz into a rear entrance, used only by delivery
autos, and in that way reached the garage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>He had asked Jack Beardsley to give him time to
get out on the lawn before he arrived, and so the
three, who were still seated around a tea table under
a spreading oak, saw Ralph coming from the house
at the same time that the tallyho entered the front
gate.</p>
<p>They little dreamed of all that had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><span class="small">TRAGIC HOURS</span></h2>
<p>And now while these young people are having
a care-free, happy time in the beautiful Orange Hill
country, let us return to the East Side that is sweltering
in the heat of late June.</p>
<p>It was nine o&rsquo;clock at night and the air was still
breathlessly stifling. The playground that edged the
East River was thronged with neighboring folk who
had brought what portable bedding they had and
who planned sleeping upon the ground out-of-doors
to catch some possible breeze from over the water.</p>
<p>Many of these people were residents of the rickety
tenement across from the model apartments, but one
there was who had been unable to leave the small,
hot room that she called home, and that one was
Mrs. Wilovich.</p>
<p>She was not alone, nor had she been, for all that
day Lena May had been at her bedside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She cannot last the night out,&rdquo; the visiting district
nurse had said. &ldquo;Hastn&rsquo;t she any own folks
to stay with her till it&rsquo;s all over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall stay,&rdquo; little Lena May had replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You? Do you think you ought? You&rsquo;re a mere
girl. Aren&rsquo;t there some women in this house who&rsquo;d
do that much for a neighbor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am seventeen,&rdquo; was the quiet reply, &ldquo;and Mrs.
Wilovich would rather have me. She never made
friends among the neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as you wish,&rdquo; the busy nurse had said.
&ldquo;I have many more places to visit this evening, so I
can&rsquo;t stay; and, anyway, there&rsquo;s nothing to do but
to let her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, please, don&rsquo;t say it. Little Tony might
hear,&rdquo; Lena May had implored in a whisper as she
glanced at the child curled up on the floor as though
he were asleep.</p>
<p>When the nurse was gone, Dean Wiggin appeared
in the open doorway, as he had many times that day
and evening. Nell had been called to the country
to see about the small farm which their foster-father
had bequeathed them, or she would have been with
Lena May. Gloria had left at eight to take her
evening classes at the Settlement, and had promised
to return at ten and remain with her sister until
the end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>The giant of a lad, with his helpless arm that was
always held in one position as it had been in slings
so long ago, glanced first at the woman in the bed,
and then at the girl who advanced to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I stay now?&rdquo; he spoke softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve closed
the shop and the office. Isn&rsquo;t there anything that
I can do to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dean, I don&rsquo;t need you, and there isn&rsquo;t
room; but I do wish that you would take Tony out
of doors. It is stifling here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little fellow seemed to hear his name. He
rose and went to Dean. The lad lifted Tony with
his strong right arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him down to the
docks a while,&rdquo; he told the girl. &ldquo;Put a light in
the window if you want me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Lena May said that she would. Then for a time
the young girl stood in the open window watching
the moving lights out on the river. At last she
turned back and glanced at the bed. The mother
lay so quiet and so white that Lena May believed
that she had passed into the land where there is no
sweltering, crowded East Side. She was right. The
tired soul had taken its flight. The girl was about
to place the lamp in the window to recall Dean when
she paused and listened. What a strange roaring
sound she heard, and how intensely hot it was becoming.
In another moment there was a wild cry
of &ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo; from the playground.</p>
<p>Lena May sprang to the open door. She knew
there was but one fire escape and that at the extreme
rear of the long, dark hallway. That very day she
had noticed that it was piled high with rubbish.
Then she must make her escape by the narrow,
rickety front stairs. Down the top flight she ran,
only to find that the flight beneath her was a seething
mass of flame.</p>
<p>She darted back into the small room and closed
the door. Then she ran to the open window and
called for help, but the roaring of the flames
drowned her voice. However, she was seen, and
several firemen ran forward with a ladder, but a
rear wall crashed in and they leaped back.</p>
<p>At that moment a lad darted up and pushed his
way through the crowd. &ldquo;Put the ladder up to
that window,&rdquo; he commanded, pointing to where
Lena May, pale and quiet, was still standing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By heck, we won&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s sure death to climb up
there. The wall&rsquo;s rocking even now. Stand back,
everybody,&rdquo; the chief shouted; but one there was
who did not obey. With superhuman effort he
lifted the ladder. Several men seeing that he was
determined helped him place it, then ran back, and
left the lad to scale it alone. Never before had
Dean so regretted his useless arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, give me strength!&rdquo; he cried; then mounted
the ladder. He could feel it sway. Flames leaped
from the windows as he passed. He caught at the
rounds with his left hand as well as his right, and
up, up he went. The girl leaned far out. &ldquo;Drop
down. Hold to the window sill! I&rsquo;ll catch you,&rdquo;
the lad called. Lena May did as she was told, and,
clinging to the top round with his left hand, Dean
clasped the girl&rsquo;s waist with his strong right arm
and climbed down as fast as he could go. He did
not realize that he was using his left arm. He had
to, it was a matter of life and death. A pain like
that made by a hot branding iron shot through his
shoulder, but even this he did not know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Firemen rushed forward and took the girl from
him, and none too soon, for with a terrific roar the
fire burst through the roof, which caved in; then
the wall tottered and crashed down about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that boy? The one that went up the
ladder?&rdquo; people were asking on all sides. Where
was he, indeed?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX.
<br /><span class="small">A HERO REWARDED</span></h2>
<p>A week later Lena May was in the sunny kitchen
of the Pensinger mansion making broth. A curly-headed
three-year-old boy was sitting on the floor
playing contentedly with his toys. He had been told
that his mother had gone to a beautiful country
where she would be well and happy and that some
day he would see her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muvver likes Tony to stay wiv you, Auntie
May,&rdquo; he prattled as the girl stooped to kiss him.
Then, as he suddenly reached up his chubby arms,
he added: &ldquo;Tony likes to stay wiv you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, the broth&rsquo;s ready and Tony may
help Auntie May,&rdquo; she told him. The little fellow
was given a plate of crackers and the girl followed
with a bowl of steaming refreshment. They went
to Bobs&rsquo; room, where a lad was lying in bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>Once again Dean Wiggin had fought a fire for
the sake of a friend, but this time had undone the
harm that had been done in the long ago. Even
the surgeon who had been called in declared that the
way the lad had wrenched his arm free and had
actually used it was little less than a miracle; but,
all through the ages, people who with a high purpose
have called upon God for help, have received it, and
that help has been named a miracle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Lena May,&rdquo; the lad said as he stretched out
his left arm, &ldquo;it moves, doesn&rsquo;t it? Stiffly, perhaps,
but I must keep it going, the doctor told me.&rdquo; Then
he drew himself into a sitting position and the girl
raised the pillows to make him comfortable.</p>
<p>He smiled at her beamingly as he said: &ldquo;Another
bit of good news is that tomorrow I may get up. Just
because one wall of a burning tenement fell on me
is no reason why I should remain in bed longer than
one week and be waited upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely had a wonderful escape, Dean,&rdquo; the
girl said as she gave him the broth. &ldquo;Just by chance
the firemen instantly turned the water where you
had fallen and so you weren&rsquo;t burned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor drowned,&rdquo; the lad said merrily, &ldquo;just
knocked senseless.&rdquo; Then, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
he continued: &ldquo;I want to be up and about before
Nell returns. She will be in about noon tomorrow.
Unless it got into the New England papers, which
isn&rsquo;t likely, she won&rsquo;t know a thing about it. I don&rsquo;t
want her to hear of it before I tell her. She would
imagine all sorts of things that aren&rsquo;t true, and be
needlessly worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How glad your sister will be when she finds that
the use of your arm has been restored to you.&rdquo; Lena
May sat by the bedside holding Tony on her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Dean&rsquo;s upward glance was radiant.
&ldquo;No longer will I have to follow the profession
of old book-seller. I want to do something that will
keep that arm constantly busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Dean, have you thought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. You won&rsquo;t think it a very wonderful
ambition. I want to be a farmer. I don&rsquo;t like
this crowded city. I feel as though I can&rsquo;t breathe.
When I am lying here alone, I keep thinking of the
New England farm where my boyhood was spent,
and I long to really work in that rocky soil, standing
up now and then to breathe deep of that
sparkling air and to gaze at that wide view over
the meadow-lands, and the shining, curving silver
ribbon, that is really a river, to the distant mountains.
Lena May, how I wish you could see it
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure that I would love it,&rdquo; the girl said,
then, rising, she added: &ldquo;Here comes Gloria and
Mr. Hardinian. They are going to hear some Hungarian
music tonight, and I promised to have an
early supper for them. Tony may stay with you.
I am sure he would like to hear a story about the
little wild creatures who live on your farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, when the girl was gone, the little fellow
accommodatingly curled up by Dean&rsquo;s side and went
to sleep, and so the lad&rsquo;s thoughts were left free to
dream of a wonderful something that might happen
some day on that far-away New England farm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<h2 id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI.
<br /><span class="small">FOUR ROMANCES</span></h2>
<p>Time&mdash;Two weeks later.</p>
<p>Place&mdash;Kitchen of the Pensinger mansion.</p>
<p>Characters&mdash;Gloria, Gwendolyn, Roberta, Lena
May and little Tony.</p>
<hr /><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t things been happening with a whirl of
late?&rdquo; Bobs exclaimed as she passed a plate of hot
muffins. &ldquo;I feel dizzy, honestly I do! I&rsquo;m so proud
of Dick,&rdquo; she added as she sank into her own place
at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of his own accord he told me that he&rsquo;s going
back for one more year at law school and then he
and Ralph are going to hang out a shingle for themselves.
They&rsquo;re going to start a new firm and be
partners. Judge Caldwaller-Cory thinks that his
son must be crazy, when he is already a junior member
of an old and well established firm. They got
the idea from Arden Wentworth, I suppose. He
has made good by himself, and the plan rather
appeals to Dick and Ralph.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re great pals, aren&rsquo;t they, these two?
Brothers couldn&rsquo;t care more for each other, I do
believe,&rdquo; Lena May said, as she buttered a muffin
for her little charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that they are to marry sisters in
the dim and distant future. That ought to cement the
brotherly ties even closer than ever,&rdquo; Gloria remarked,
as she smiled at Gwendolyn, who, wind-browned
and sun-rosy, looked as though she had
never been ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwen, you and Ralph fell in love rather suddenly,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Lena May inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; her sister replied. &ldquo;Ralph says that
he has always felt sure that he would know the girl
who was meant for him the very moment that he
saw her, and he insists that he loved me the minute
he met me at Orange Hills Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>Roberta leaned over and placed her hand on that
of her sister. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for I do
believe that Ralph is almost as fine a chap as my
Dick, and that is saying a great deal; and to think
that if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the Pensinger mystery, we
might never have met him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Gloria remarked, &ldquo;what has become
of the Pensinger mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta laughed as she arose to replenish the
muffin plate from the oven. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is destined
to always remain a mystery. Ralph and I followed
every clue we could possibly think of. It&rsquo;s a
shame, isn&rsquo;t it, not to have this old place owned by
someone, to say nothing of the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Gloria asked: &ldquo;Lena
May, was there any news of general interest in
Dean&rsquo;s letter this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their youngest sister smiled brightly. &ldquo;Oh, yes,
indeed. He was so glad to get back to that New
England farm where he can breathe. He said that
there are wonderful possibilities in the old house
and that he is going to begin work on it at once.
He hopes that by the time I am eighteen, it will
look like a real home; but there was another item
in the letter that I am sure you will all be glad
to hear. His group of nature poems has been
accepted by a magazine called <i>The New England
Homestead</i>, and the check they sent seems like
a real fortune to Dean. The best of it is, they have
asked for more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great! I for one shall be most proud to have a
poet for a brother-in-law.&rdquo; Then to Lena May:
&ldquo;Maybe you thought you were keeping it a secret
from us, little one, but you weren&rsquo;t, and we&rsquo;re glad,
just as glad as we can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their youngest, shining-eyed, looked up at the
oldest sister, who sat at the head of the table, then
she said: &ldquo;Of course I had told Glow, because she
is Mother to us, but after that letter from Dean this
morning, I want to tell you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then merrily Bobs exclaimed: &ldquo;Now, Gloria,
we&rsquo;ve all &rsquo;fessed up but you. Aren&rsquo;t you and Mr.
Hardinian going to be married some day and live
happily ever after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew two people who seemed better
suited for each other,&rdquo; Gwendolyn commented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Gloria smiled. &ldquo;And what would you have us
live on, dear? You know that it takes Mr. Hardinian&rsquo;s
entire income to pay the expenses of his
Boys&rsquo; Club. Of course the little chaps pay five cents
a night for a bunk when they have work, but he has
to loan money to others who are out of work, who
might take to stealing if they had no other way to
procure food. However, they have never failed to
pay him back when they did get work.&rdquo; Their oldest
sister&rsquo;s enthusiastic praise of the welfare worker told
how great was her admiration for that truly noble
young man, if nothing more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crickets, what was that?&rdquo; Bobs suddenly exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the telephone, my dear,&rdquo; Lena May remarked.
&ldquo;Bobsy, will you answer it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later that girl fairly plunged back
into the kitchen, her shining eyes assuring them that
she had heard something of an astonishing nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Ralph,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as she sank down
into the nearest chair. &ldquo;The mystery is solved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solved?&rdquo; her sisters repeated inquiringly and all
at once. &ldquo;How? When? Who is the heir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberta laughed. &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s where I resign
as a detective,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had three cases
and although each one has been successfully solved
in spite of me, it has not been because of any cleverness
on my part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Bobs, do tell us what Ralph said. We&rsquo;re
bursting with curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My partner-detective feels as chagrined about it
as I do, for the solution of the mystery just turned
up; we neither of us ferreted it out as we had hoped
that we would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bobita, you&rsquo;re just trying to tantalize us,&rdquo; Gwen
declared. &ldquo;Do tell us from the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, I will. Ralph said that his dad
happened to recall recently something which his
father had once told him. You know it was Ralph&rsquo;s
grandfather who was the intimate friend and legal
advisor of Mr. Pensinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that a week before his death, Mr.
Pensinger had sent some important papers and a
letter to the office of Mr. Caldwaller-Cory, the
grandfather, you understand. Just as he was about
to examine them, he was called away on urgent business
and he left the papers on his desk, expecting to
return soon. The Cory building was even then in
the process of construction, but Ralph&rsquo;s grandfather
had moved in before it was quite completed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That day the floor was being put down in the
room adjoining the small office. Later, when Mr.
Caldwaller-Cory returned, his mind was so filled
with the intricacies of the new case which had just
been given to him, that he did not even notice that
the brown packet containing the Pensinger papers
was gone; in fact, he had forgotten that it ever existed;
but a week later, when he received word that
his friend, Mr. Pensinger, had died suddenly, he
recalled the papers and began to search for them,
but they were never found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know where they were,&rdquo; Lena May said
brightly, &ldquo;under the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobs nodded, her eyes glowing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it!&rdquo;
she affirmed. &ldquo;Recently Judge Caldwaller-Cory said
to Ralph, &lsquo;Either we will have to tear down this old
building of ours or we will have to renovate it and
bring it up to date.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph is romantic enough to want to retain the
atmosphere of the days of his grandfather, and so
he favored the latter plan. Soon carpenters were
tearing up the office floors to replace them with hard
wood and the packet was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in those papers, had Mr. Pensinger made
some different disposition of his property?&rdquo; Gloria
inquired.</p>
<p>Bobs nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It seems that
Mr. Pensinger, after his wife&rsquo;s death, visited Hungary,
found his daughter Marilyn, who lived but a
short time, and so, as he was without an heir, he
had written Mr. Caldwaller-Cory, requesting him to
use the Pensinger fortune wherever he thought it
would be most needed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What will become of this house?&rdquo; Lena May
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph didn&rsquo;t say. He wants to tell that himself.
In fact, he said that he was coming right up
in The Whizz and that he wasn&rsquo;t coming alone,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that Dick De Laney will be with him,&rdquo;
Gloria remarked as she cleared the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going to be kept long in suspense,&rdquo;
Gwendolyn said, &ldquo;for The Whizz just passed the
window and there&rsquo;s the knocker. Shall I go to the
door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before her sisters could reply, that maiden was
half-way down the long hall, and a second later she
reappeared with Ralph at her side. Two other young
men followed closely. One indeed was Dick De
Laney and the other was Mr. Hardinian. His dark,
expressive eyes showed that he was much mystified
by all that was happening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go into the salon?&rdquo; Gloria inquired
when greetings were over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed. This dining-room corner with its
cheerful grate fire is the pleasantest part of the old
house,&rdquo; Ralph declared. &ldquo;Dick, help me bring in
another chair or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now sit down, everybody, and I&rsquo;ll tell you the
results of my conference with my father.&rdquo; Ralph
was plainly elated about something, which, as yet,
he had revealed to no one.</p>
<p>When they were seated, he turned at once to the
tall, dark Hungarian. &ldquo;Mr. Hardinian, you were
telling me last week that your temporary wooden
building for the Boys&rsquo; Club is to be torn down next
month that a tobacco factory may be erected, were
you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply of the still puzzled young
man. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine where I am to take my boys.
I don&rsquo;t like to have them bunkless even for one
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, nor shall they be,&rdquo; Ralph continued.
Then he looked at the girls beamingly.
&ldquo;Not if these young ladies will consent to having
a model clubhouse erected in the old garden back of
their mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph, how wonderful that would be!&rdquo; Gloria
exclaimed. &ldquo;But what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; the lad replied. &ldquo;The former
owner of this place wanted his fortune used for
some good cause, and Dad and I thought that it
would be great to help Mr. Hardinian carry on his
fine work right here on this very spot as a sort of
memorial, and couldn&rsquo;t it be called The Pensinger
Boys&rsquo; Club, or something like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it could,&rdquo; Mr. Hardinian&rsquo;s dark eyes
expressed his appreciation more than words could
have done. Then to the tall girl at his side he said:
&ldquo;Now, many of our dream-plans for the boys can
be made a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the others, he continued: &ldquo;I am sure
that Gloria is now willing that I should tell you that
she had consented to some day mother all of our
boys, and because of this splendid new plan, I hope
that the some-day may be very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was. Indeed, before another year had
passed, each of the girls was in a home of her own.</p>
